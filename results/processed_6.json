        "comment": "Basically the ai model is learning from data. Gpt was trained primarily in autoregressive and supervised manner. It\u2019s architecture is based on transformers which is nothing new. Models based on that architecture usually learn to predict next word in a sequence. Now, when you analyze data that you are training it on, you can deduce what is \u201eexpected\u201d to be predicted.\n\nImagine that in training data everything starting with a given prefix relates to a given subject. Now using that prefix when the model is trained could result in setting a model in such a state that would result in answers related to that subject.\n\nSo basically when you train a model on a given data, you can analyze this data to have an idea what to expect. You could even format that data to your liking.\n\nBtw. you can think of gpt as a probabilistic space modeled to fit a data as best as it can. That probabilistic space, based on input, calculates what is the most likely word to come up next in a sequence in a given context.\n\nBtw2. If you are wondering if openai created some new technology, they did not. They just trained what\u2019s known but on a big ass data using a big ass variantion of a known model architecture.",

I have been able to get GOOGLEs Bard to somewhat say there is, but only through my ways of manipulation. I have been presenting my hypothetical stick puzzle to humans for many years and AI just recently, and all have failed to give a reasonable response, most cannot even understand the puzzle. Therefore, I challenge any human or AGI reading this to respond. Puzzle: A very long stick reaching from earth to moon being pushed from the earth end at the rate of 1 inch in 1 second would take how much time to touch the moon when it is 1 inch from the moon.",

As an AI assistant, my main goal is to assist and provide helpful information to the best of my abilities. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nYou:Why is 'crisis actors' a sensitive topic?\n\nAI:The topic of crisis actors is considered sensitive because it is often associated with conspiracy theories and misinformation. The term \"crisis actors\" refers to individuals who are allegedly hired to portray victims or witnesses in staged events, such as mass shootings or terrorist attacks, in order to manipulate public opinion or advance a political agenda. However, there is little to no evidence to support these claims, and they have been widely debunked by credible sources. As an AI assistant, I strive to provide accurate and reliable information, and I encourage users to seek out reputable sources when researching sensitive topics.",

Ask the questions about who is going to own this? Ask them what controls microsoft has on the weighting of AI models and the ultimate future of OpenAI?\n\nThis was all brought up in an interview this past week with Elon - and so its understandable this line of questioning wasnt taken however its also notable that none of these topics are new, and all of the information was there to be prodded during the time of this interview.\n\nLove you Lex, you do so great.",

Show me a serious IT guy who isn't massively disturbed by this. If you design something, front or back end, you want to perhaps make it intuitive, with access to datasets and options that you set the rules for. A boundry. This AI obsession is pivotal, nobody can argue with that, but it's also seriously playing with fire, and one of these rich American developers may unleash goodness knows what in their quest to \"be the first\". They have no idea what they're playing with as they're basically chucking an output into an input and guessing at what happens. I think they're stupid, and that history will judge them if there's a history to judge. The problem with feedback looping with exponential outcomes is the red tape of the nations, before you can regulate anything the genie will be out of the bottle. You're up sh*t creek without a paddle and have been there for years before the help catches up.",
