McDonnell was commissioned to work on the Gateway Experience in the 1980s at a time in US history when the nation was taking a deep interest in different varieties of psychic research   Gateway is a CIA technique and was essentially described as a training system to bring enhanced strength, focus and coherence to the amplitude and frequency of brainwave output\n\nIts uses, according to the CIA report, ranged from converting energy to heal one\u2019s body to travelling across space and time to learn and access new information.  Sound nuts?  Maybe.  But the \n CIA approved this for testing and it's real.  The project was classified by the CIA until 2003.  I'd love to know if McDonnell is looking forward to what happens to our consciousness after death, time travel, and physical healing etc etc.  I think you'd be fascinated by getting him into the studio.  Peace!",

        "comment": "From my understanding the existence of AGI relies on two factors: the possibility of reproducing biological functions on a processor and the collective effort and labor of the whole mankind manifested largely over the internet in the form of data. The role of Open AI and companies like them is to determine the first factor, but do they have the right to be solely responsible of using the collective efforts and labor of mankind for their need without question ? A quote from Isaac Newton seems appropriate: \u201cIf I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\u201d I'm curious what the hive mind thinks.\nedit: of course by AGI I don't mean ChatGPT. Altman proposes a similar dialogue around 34:00 but I wonder, if the legal consensus would be to not process copyrighted data in any way or form (some people claim GPT is piracy on an unprecedented scale) then what ?",

While I cannot make any commitments on behalf of Lex Friedman or any podcast creators, it is generally a good idea to consider publishing transcripts alongside each episode.",

        "comment": "We tell ourselves that we are weak for not pushing ourselves at least 5 days a week. But with the revolution brought upon by AI, I think people in the future will look back and commend us for our struggles while condemning us for our crimes; just as we do our ancestors. My parents say they walked up hill both ways to school, while my grandparents walked uphill both ways in snow. Now we walk up hill one way, and it is our duty to wall this to ensure our children walk downhill both ways. With AI we can provide this, turn the 40 hour workweek into a 20 which will enable everyone to spend more time with the ones they love; this is what matters.\n\nThe goal is not to create lazy people, the goal is to give people the freedom to do what they want with their lives. Maybe once they have this freedom they will realize they dont mind the 40 hour work week.\n\nAt least that is what I hope.",
