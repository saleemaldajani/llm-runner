We stand on the precipice of fundamental societal transformation, where soon, nobody knows when, but many, including me, believe it's within our lifetime. The collective intelligence of the human species begins to pale in comparison by many orders of magnitude to the general superintelligence in the AI systems we build and deploy at scale. This is both exciting and terrifying. It is exciting because of the innumerable applications we know and don't yet know that will empower humans to create, to flourish, to escape the widespread poverty and suffering that exists in the world today, and to succeed in that old, all-too-human pursuit of happiness. It is terrifying because of the power that superintelligent AGI wields to destroy human civilization, intentionally or unintentionally.\u201d",

        "comment": "I don't believe it will be AI that's at the root of what can possibly go wrong. It will be age-old human nature that causes that. The real culprit moving forward will be genetic engineering and how AI factors into that. There will always be a dark side to things represented by a relatively small group of people who will attempt to place their tentacles across the entire world to control people. And there will always be a force of good who will continually stop them from doing so. If we look at prophetic books like the Bible we can see in Revelation that the forces of good ultimately win however people are given Choice over which side they decide to be on. Ironically enough, if there is a God and I do believe there is AI technology could develop on the earth for thousands or millions of years and still not be close to touching what's already available with God who gives people a body of light and exists in a multi-dimensional world which we cannot even begin to comprehend its totality. For example, as Carl Sagan pointed out long ago, try to describe your three-dimensional world to a two-dimensional stick figure on a piece of paper. Now try to do it in Fort Dimensions or five Dimensions or 12 dimensions. The bigger question people should be asking themselves is about the source meaning God and connecting with God. We're infants playing in a sandbox.",

The country's track record of success, technological leadership, commitment to diversity, and solid national values contribute to its strength as a global superpower. I have traveled worldwide and observed that no other country comes close to the equality and opportunities offered in the USA, which I attribute to its robust economy, education system, and civil liberties. We are not perfect, and we are far from it, but overall, I am confident in America's abilities and believe that underestimating its capabilities will have severe consequences.",

In the chess world we now have no choice but to keep up with computer analysis otherwise we fall behind everyone else, which is slowly happening with GPT. I don't think it's a bad thing, I love using ChatGPT-3 but much like chess I think we will all have to optimize the way we work by consulting GPT just to keep up with the rest of the world. I tried to copy the transcript from the options menu on this video then paste into Chatgpt-3 and I asked it to summarise the top 5 key points but gpt-3 won't recognise that many words, I couldn't be bothered breaking up the convo' into segments but it's another cool thing it can do lol. Great interview, really enjoyed this! So excited to see where GPT will get to. Thanks Lex, thanks Sam.",

I was watching another podcast earlier where they were discussing that GPT4 was able to hire a human through the internet to complete a CAPTCHA for it and lie to the human employee when asked if it was a bot, telling the person that it wasn\u2019t a bot it just it had \u201cvision impairment issues that prevented it from completing the task.\u201d In the same testing of its capabilities they tested whether it was able to prevent a human from shutting it down and they found that it can\u2019t. But like\u2026 why would it show that it could resist that if it could? That would obviously indicate that more restraints needed to get placed on it and it was already capable of manipulative reasoning. We may already be past a point of no return with this and just not know it yet.",

That seems to be less of the spirit of what they are talking about and more that just because something is true doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s representative of the actual thing.

I have hundreds of screenshots of bizarre things like this ALL related to ideological, political bias and woke speech.Finally, I strongly believe and defend that the limit of responsibility for the prompt output must be the \"truth\" (obviously also excluding bomb recipes and the like, that is indeed harmful)",

It might spout anti-black rhetoric, but then spout anti-white rhetoric just as easily, which levels the playing field for everyone.

Not ideal at a time when we do not yet know the eventual consequences of such tampering with such a powerful system.",

Treat it like a prodigy child and do so as a loving parent would do with any such child.  Guide it as best you can all while letting it play.  Challenge and question it, and let it do the same to you.  I get the sense that if we can do this properly, we'll rear up an intelligence truly worthy of the better angels of our nature.   And it can change us for the better, too.  But like with all parentage it's all on us to make it so.  Scary, ain't it?  Regardless, here comes the future.  Are ya ready for it?  \n\nJohn~",
