        "comment": "I have a few questions, Googe had all these technologies and products and services which were similar and could be evolved into like Facebook or Whatsapp or Amazon or OpenAI or Tesla or even Microsoft or IBM. Why did Google only go behind money through ads intruding People's privacy instead of making products like Orkut, Android, Hangouts, Waymo etc? Today, companies like IBM, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft etc etc had the power and money to be into many verticals, but they only wanted to defeat other's products and hide any innovation until a rival releases a competition. The same things could be achieved by these companies and done even earlier. We are still getting computers with i3 and i5 at  double the rate when it was released. Companies are not releasing technology to public as they might get into financial problems if they don't have new tech after releasing new tech. This is all a flawed system. What China did, could be achieved by any Country, but got burried in the Political corruption. Fuel prices are hiked and those companies have shares in retal and they then raise retail prices and same continues, but poor salary stays same. A hike of a penny for fuel bring a lot of money to  the company per day, but the expenses never go that much high for them, but repeats it regularly. Employees are not paid using that also! I need to understand if the principles and formulas are hacked in the process for making power and rich more powerful and rich! Even the Bitcoin and Stocks go in unexpected ways like for example someone farted in some company and their stocks goes down and if Diamond is found in Russia, pharma coompany stocks goes up etc. Its a mess completely. I don't understand!",

        "comment": "I'm just telling my thoughts.. .Please feel free to correct me. The concept of money between people should go away. We get everything at our home and nothing is exciting. When we had Movie Theatres and Radios in the old time before Internet, people used to gather and had a lot of fun and family values existed. Today, we have everything in our Homes and we don't interact with People naturally. We only interact if there is a purpose of getting something done. Every person should have a responsibility and it would be very easy life without greed and violence. There won't be a concept of someone not willing to work as it becomes easy work. Sexual offences too would go away when people gather and meet occassionally. The glory of the past might return if we separate our lives from technology between common people. Technology like AGI can be used to get things done at ease where people Supervise or monitor them. Today we have a problem where the people at the top with power are controlling everything and corrupt. They are the reason why common people become bad and mad. If the top powerful people are replaced with a group of people from different geographies, it would be a great opportunity for younger generation to grow. Also, investing power in people for long also gets to be a problem. Now, we are facing a lot of problems with the Cost of living crisis. People at the top say, they cannot increase salary, because they are paid well and not in a bad situation. The concept of salary should be equal for each and it should only be about status, so greater good comes. In UK, everybody is protesting and the only thing happening is prices are hiked and salary is only to cover the rent or mortgage with energy and water bills. What should common people do? In the entire World, there is something wrong with the entire system including the government, Judicial and enforcement systems, they are in the old ice age era! We might be in a simulation too like AGI. We are not able to find any life forms outside planets. Whatever Man has done affects only earth and a little bit of space and if Man goes, everything returns to how it would have happened. We are told Global Warming is caused due to pollution, nobody tells that it is 100% or 50%  caused by it, we have iinformation about hpow celestial objects form and die and Global Warming too can be a part of that. But, Globar Warming and anything is just commercialized to have business. What happens if electricity stops completely?, then the entire bubble bursts and we get our lives back! If basic amenities are given to common people and AGI is used for supporting food, habitat, entertainment, betterment etc, it would be a greeat World!",

I wish you woulda pushed more, cuz he knows EXACTLY what that means (fkn kidding me?!). And his response proves that he is one woke mofo. ChatGPT is EXTREMELY woke. You can't even ask it about curse words (which of course can be anything, under the oppressive thumb of woke ideology) wihtout it issuing a disclaimer about being \"inclusive and respectful of all individuals,\" the program apologies for nearly everything (if you're asking interesting questions), uses terms like \"birthing person,\" etc.. the list goes on.. just play with it and you see that it is WOKE AF.\nIt's VERY disturibing that idologues like Sam are in control of these systems. AND this idea that it has a mind of its own, that the programmers have little direct control ove its responses is total BS. If they gave it an avatar, it'd be a blue-haired pregnant man waving a rainbow flag, shitting on the American flag and the Bible, while killing a baby with one hand and castrating a child with the other. I think the people who are worried about AI aren't exactly worried about the right things. It may take jobs, it may become smarter than people, but the real danger is far more insidious.",

Unlike so many other products of its type, this CD does not have bad synthesizer music, does not feature a phony or affected style of narration, and does not make any bogus claims to be  subliminal  or to  re-train the brain  or any of that balderdash. What you get is 1. a guided meditation for getting into a pleasantly relaxed state of body awareness while taking a stroll (superb for those easing back into a fitness routine slowly after an illness or injury) 2. A nice long breath-awareness relaxation session that if followed diligently can put you into very deep states of full-body relaxation and mental calmness, and 3. a buddhist-inspired meditation session designed to help you develop and maintain feelings of loving kindness toward not just yourself and your friends, but toward people you don't even like. The CD makes no claims to be designed for advanced meditators or for buddhists or hindus/yoga practitioners looking for very deep and esoteric stuff. It is geared more toward the average person who just wants to develop the habit of relaxation and stress relief through natural, healthy means. him, if you happen to be reading this, keep up the good work fella, and I love your accent. I would also like to note that I have never fallen asleep while listening to this product. I would like to kindly suggest to the reviewer who said this CD makes him fall asleep, that he might want to get checked to see if he has a sleep disorder, or if he is simply not setting aside ample time for restful sleep at night. A healthy person getting adequate rest at night should be able to go into deep states of mental relaxation without dozing off, if not all the time, then most of the time.",

Also, the interviewer says 'it's the beautiful place to be, terriffying but beautiful', tell this to people who will lose their jobs and can't requalify or change the company or relocate because this has been rolled out too quickly. You can fool yourself for all that it's worth.",

Lying and faking in human beings to be non human to avoid responsibility is the real indicator of intelligence,  indistinguishable from human subject is still too vague and rough.",
