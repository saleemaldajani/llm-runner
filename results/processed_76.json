Not that it would need to collapse, but high-frequency traders and others must be in on the change as financial stakeholders in a transition to low profits. Here's a prompt: What is the best way to lower profits by 50% and increase productivity in the next 60 months? Obviously, if it is pre-trained in economics it would reply that you need to hire more people and build.",

If our social structures divide us and  eggs us against one another, any increase in our powers to build become immediately powers to destroy (and self destroy). Aligning our individual priorities so that optimization is not premature (D Knuth ref) involves a process of radical global democratization of our societies. Lex\u2019s beliefs of a rigid human nature, which are shared by too many people and flow constantly from the current social order, limit our ability to achieve such alignment.  We need to overcome them and also abandon the dream of a tech fix to our vexing social problems.  Two cents. (I don\u2019t mean to single Lex out, whom I love as a brother who puts himself out there and produces so much thoughtful and interesting material.  I just disagree strongly with his insistence on the notion of evil, selfishness, power hunger, or stupidity as inherent to the human condition.)",

We don't really have good definitions for either of those things. I don't think we thought both of these things would be getting here so quickly so we all never bothered to come up with good firm definitions for either. Which is why we're all questioning. imo I think AGI will happen without us even realizing at first. The creators of it might not even realize either.",

At current development speed models pass additional tests faster that we add new ones. The only important thing that I personally miss now to consider it legit AGI is continuous learning / long term memory. Without it interacting with models feel like talking to very knowledgable old dude with dementia - he remember perfectly what happend during WW2, but completely forgets what you've talked about 10 minutes ago.\n\nAnd with consciousness - good luck. Philosophers have debated about it for 2000 years. It's purely subjective experience - there is no scientific experiment you can do to distinguish \"real\" consciousness from \"simulated\" one. My guess is that at some point pro-life/green crowd will arbitrarily define some criteria that AI will have to pass to be considered conscious: if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it must be a duck.",
