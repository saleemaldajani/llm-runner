        "comment": "It seems to me like we are feeding those models with textual data and think we can magically \"generate\" what we call \"intelligence\", or even consciousness. The thing is that \"intelligence\" is not about delivering data, it's about understanding concepts, approaching the truth. Consciousness is about having the concept of self, as opposed to the concept of the world, and having the concept of both being fused together. So it's a much more complex task than just delivering data.\n\nI think that to build AGI we need to think differently that to just feed a model with data. It's really about learning and understanding things, so there must be a process like the one we all lived in our lives, when we were born and learned everything we know from experience; There must be this way of having a \"pre-wired\" brain, but waiting to be filled with connections that matter to us because they are part of our experience of the world.\n\nSo to me, that's the only way we can even think of reaching something close to AGI, but even then, I'm not sure a machine is capable of experience understanding or consciousness because everything it does is based on calculus, and when we experience life and concepts, we ain't calculating anything, our consciousness is on the dimension of ideas itself. But I believe that we could nonetheless reach a very good \"intelligence\" mimicking maching, that could really fool us into believing it's conscious, and that it \"understands\" things, because it will be like a mirror of ourselves.",

The current trend is crazy exponential improvements in a fairly constrained domain, but that would be a lateral shift. I think consciousness is a reflection process. Not reflection of light but of thoughts. I don't doubt that you could engineer it with hardware and/or software, but it would be harder to pinpoint when it had happened that way, and you'd be always second guessing yourself. If it just self-emerged, there would be very little doubt. We immediately recognize it in the eyes of other animals and see a gradient of it as you get to less and less complex brains.",
