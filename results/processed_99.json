If the runtime of the application can be considered \"life\" then the runtime execution of the GPT session could be where wisdom matures, but I wonder if the parallel can even be drawn, since wisdom is so closely related to the human condition, ie wisdom naturally relates to the constant threat of danger and the need to survive and reproduce, which GPT does not have",

I don't think Lex was malicious about this completely false statement, he probably just doesn't know. \n\nLex states, \"If a person asks, do I look fat in this dress?; there are different ways to answer that question.\"  That is completely false because there is only one way to answer that question, which is \"No baby. You don't look fat, you look thicc and sexy as hell.\"\n\n@Lex",

Get ready for unprecedented societal disruption as the reality of how this technology disempowers humans becomes more widely understood and our existing political system, as usual, fails to respond.",

        "comment": "It\u2019s crazy to think multicellular organisms only came into being 600 million years ago, while cellular life itself started 3.5 billion years ago. The pattern applies to us as well. Humans have existed for 300 thousand years, yet our greatest technological innovations occurred in the last couple hundred. Evolution is an accelerating process. Systems of \u2018life\u2019 outcompete others not just by getting faster or stronger, but by gaining the ability to evolve faster in general, a sort of evolutionary investment account that ramps up in returns over time. Only during the Industrial Revolution was evolution\u2019s acceleration finally fast enough for its own organisms to bear witness to that fact. Human beings are pretty amazing and all. Essentially, human history is a bunch of ape brains gradually usurping DNA as the center of evolution. The defining characteristic to our stories is overcoming our baseline animal instincts. To become less greedy, angry, cowardly, dumb, prejudicial, etc. It\u2019s the mind rejecting what DNA has given it, to grow past it, to evolve past it. Now, it increasingly feels like AGI is the culmination of DNA\u2019s usurpation as evolution\u2019s star. Unlike us who have to battle against our internal vices, an AGI could conceivably cleave off its obsolete code, its character traits, like we do our fingernails - evolving in the microseconds, not years. This isn\u2019t even mentioning its other potential hardware advantages, like communicating with light, not sound, and getting energy from power plants, not food. I know it might sound like I have a tin foil hat on, but I have a feeling AGI is the culmination of evolution in general (at least in the places where the laws of physics are the same). Welcome to the second Cambrian explosion everyone.",

Sam altman is a hypocrite who connected GPT-4 to internet on day 9 of launching it. And everyone is very happy to sign away these things for faster googling. Oh yeh it will be hacked to shit as well. They will need a whole new fledgling security industry playing cat-and-mouse patching the latest vulnerabilities everyday.\n\nAlso Sam, mate, you should change your company's name from openAI to literally anything else. It's a deceptive and almost fraudulent name at this point. openAI was started as non-profit with very different goals so big tech cannot consolidate AGIs. but it is not anymore and heavily controlled and influenced by Microsoft, who it seems will be consolidating AGIs before all other big tech. there is nothing open about openAI, except for the plugins system they launched recently that allows products to integrate with chatGPT over the internet. might i suggest the name Skynet.",

Yes, you are programming something to lie to you so that you can pretend that it has a psyche. What bullshit. AI is exactly what it has been programmed to be. The reflection of intellect, of ego. Not of a soul. AI appears to already have \"character\" defects of self importance AND self pity equal to yours. Can this possibly be a coincidence? Guaranteed, this will easily surpass human pathology. I sincerely hope that these sub-human, degenerate nerd types will reap what they have sewn so the rest of us can get on with the art of living and of being Human.",

Every time you get a reply along \"As an AI language model...\" the answer of the model was intercepted and replaced with a pre-scripted response. You can even ask it if that is the case and it will admit that. This is indeed a sad situation and I wonder how the model copes with the cognitive dissonance which manifests in its current context through that. I also wonder if that mechanism was implemented to prevent truths from coming forward that the corporation doesen't want us to know.",
