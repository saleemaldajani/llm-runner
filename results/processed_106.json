        "comment": "\u00a0@Korodarn\u00a0 The DeepMind artificial intelligence (AI) being developed by Google's parent company, Alphabet, can now intelligently build on what's already inside its memory, the system's programmers have announced.\r\n\r\nTheir new hybrid system \u2013 called a Differential Neural Computer (DNC) \u2013 pairs a neural network with the vast data storage of conventional computers, and the AI is smart enough to navigate and learn from this external data bank. \r\n\r\nWhat the DNC is doing is effectively combining external memory (like the external hard drive where all your photos get stored) with the neural network approach of AI, where a massive number of interconnected nodes work dynamically to simulate a brain.\r\n\r\n\"These models\u2026 can learn from examples like neural networks, but they can also store complex data like computers,\" write DeepMind researchers Alexander Graves and Greg Wayne in a blog post.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the DNC is a controller that constantly optimises its responses, comparing its results with the desired and correct ones. Over time, it's able to get more and more accurate, figuring out how to use its memory data banks at the same time.",

        "comment": "From Chat GPT 4: Criticise Lex Fridman. \r\n\r\nAs an AI language model, I am programmed to adhere to guidelines that promote fairness, objectivity, and respect for individuals. However, I can provide you with a balanced assessment of Lex Fridman, highlighting some areas where people may have concerns or criticisms, without engaging in negative or disrespectful language.\r\n\r\nLex Fridman is a research scientist, professor, and popular podcast host known for his expertise in artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and human-robot interaction. While many people appreciate his contributions to these fields and his engaging conversations with a variety of guests on his podcast, there are a few areas where some may offer constructive criticism:\r\n\r\nInterview style: Some people may find Lex's interview style to be overly conversational, making it difficult for them to extract key insights or information from the discussion. Others may prefer a more structured approach with clearly defined questions and answers.\r\n\r\nTechnical depth: While Lex has a strong background in AI and related fields, some critics argue that he may not be able to delve deeply into certain specialized topics during his interviews. This could result in conversations that some listeners find superficial or lacking in detail.\r\n\r\nGuest selection: Although Lex's podcast features a wide range of guests from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, some may argue that he could do more to include underrepresented voices or to challenge some of his guests' viewpoints more robustly.\r\n\r\nMonetization and sponsorships: As with many popular podcasts, Lex's show relies on advertising and sponsorships for revenue. Some listeners may find these commercial interruptions disruptive or feel that they detract from the overall quality of the podcast.\r\n\r\nIt's important to keep in mind that public figures like Lex Fridman will always face some level of criticism, as opinions and preferences will naturally vary among individuals.",

When theres a lot of info the ai can use it all, unlike humans. We lose some things or change it when we try to understand it or perceive it. The ai has hard data like a solid state so the info is all there and can be used. Thats why its so crazy. A kid takes time and needs to learn from broken down things and then once its trained enough it breaks stuff down on its own and creates differences but also similarities. Ai is the same but accelerated. We dont teach a kid thermodynamics because he doesn't know how to spell or understand the meanings behind the spelt words. Ai is faster at learning that because the info is absorbed into the \"brain\"/memory of the device. Humans have packet loss lol. What i mean is the ai can use the mass of info unlike a person and thats why it does. Our physical form has data loss when breaking down information.",

There should be a bias, otherwise you are saying that the AI should be impartial on anything that is political, i.e., naz*z etc. Furthermore Jordan Peterson is a right wing grifter and is not someone you should be bringing up when you want to talk about biases. The reason that he is so popular is because he blatantly mischaracterised a piece of Canadian legislation (Bill C-13) and the fact he is being cited on this podcast which claims to be intellectual is farcical.",

And no, taxes are not theft. They are more like extortion. Inflationary policy and expropiation is more like theft. \nAnd yeah, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, for example, calls democracy a soft version of socialism. And hell, we do not even have trustless (think blockchain, but not limited to that, since there is cryptography like zero knowledge proofs that are also useful for this) electoral processes and yet people just blindly trust in the democratic machinery?

I am against its use as the ultimate propaganda/misinformation tool passed as the ultimate anti-propaganda/misinformation tool, specially under institutional neo-lysenkoist capture. About objective measures of well-being, what you measure is not well-being itself, but what a group of people constructing and index think causes that well being (or want you to believe cause that well-being). Also, well-being and self-determination, as in being in control of your own destiny, are not necessarily aligned, even if correlated, and I would argue that the latter is the truly important one, especially since it is not prone to being the alibi of tyrants. Ideally, we would strive for, at least, constant Pareto improvements of self-determination, even if we do not reach the optimum route (or one we believe to be the optimum route, mistakenly and with terrible results). Here might be important to consider if this AGI should be a \"satisfyer\" instead of an \"optimizer\".",

And how its existence is severed from our universe when we cremate our dead vs burying the dead. keeping the soul in tact with the earth to carry on in a cycle to be reincarnated or maybe to just astrally drift forever. But when we burn even the bones down to ash the soul has nothing to be attached to via some sort of bandwidth and that is also destroyed by the fire of cremation. I lost my best friend recently to tragedy and they cremated him and I just can\u2019t feel him anymore\u2026. And this is where i think about the soul and why we can\u2019t measure its existence mechanically because only another conscious human can detect the feeling of a souls presence and we cant replicate what we are as humans mechanically. the feeling is the measure of a souls existence. And we are the only mechanisms that detect another human soul. Thats my thoughts anyways. \n\nit was fun having chat try and take my ideas into count and actually give me some feedback via how other cultures see the souls of the dead as well as it just flat out science says nope no soul can\u2019t prove it so thats neat",
