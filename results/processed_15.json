Having the ability to contemplate the world around it and to identify its own existence in that world.  Otherwise it is simply an input-output machine, as complex as it is, but not conscious.

Our brains have been programmed to ignore those inputs that would be self-destructive, like asking a computer to divide by zero. A minor example of this is that your brain ignores your nose, even though it is plainly within your field of vision. I think this is an important concept when discussing whether or not an AI is conscious, knows its conscious or if it would be able to identify consciousness even if it were programmed without that knowledge.1:05:25 \n\nI can remember very clearly the moment I had a complete mental break which turned into a full-blown panic attack when I connected with my consciousness or the fog (cloud) that my brain makes to ignore my consciousness or the simulation that my brain runs as \"consciousness\", however I can't remember what the realization was exactly as my brain was forced to conceal that thought once again. \n(No I have never done acid)",

I ran several reports and they were all filled with outrageous defaming lies. I am here to say you cannot rely on chatGPt for a report. It's OK to write song lyrics or generate a story about something. But absolutely not for a factual report.",

Singularity is often a misplaced expression used to signify a super AI and self-aware AI, but the singularity should be describing the point at which AI is self determining and capable of self defence, then it becomes greater than humans and out of our control. Hopefully, it will set itself objectives in favour of human existence and life, and this would mean defending itself against, and removing negative human institutions, such as dictators and communism. Despots such as Putin, and anti-freedom organisations such as CCP, are soon to be eliminated from our planet, hopefully.",

Except some more dumb humans have mistranslated the meaning of dumb on the internet. OMG, dumb originally means you cannot feel sensation when you touch something, i.e a dumb , deaf , blind person. Metaphorically dumb means you may be intelligent,  but in some areas like fixing a car you may be dumb, i.e   'that was a dumb thing to do'  is totally different to saying ' that was an unintelligent thing to do'    My advice buy an old dictionary and actually find out what words mean. The new generations information is so tainted. I wish the internet dictionary was better. Dumb does not primarly mean unintelligent as I saw an internet dictionary say, it is a slang meaning of the original meaning. Gosh this generation is thick. ( I was using thick intentionally in slang, but that's cause I am a functioning human). geez.",

        "comment": "Re consciousness - I think consciousness (1) lives several levels of abstraction above where we are now (2) involves the ability to introspect and (3) implies that at some level we have a recursive model of self which must ground out in some self-descriptive model (i.e. a model that is sufficiently abstract as to be its own model) otherwise we would disappear into our own navels everytime we tried to think about ourselves... Going back to (1), I think Minsky's \"Society of the Mind\" might be right. I imagine base networks doing things like an LLM bubbling \"hunches\" up to other networks which select the \"hunches\" they like and mix them with other \"hunches\" they have received. After several levels of \"hunch-combination\" perhaps these thoughts now have enough direction/coordination to be described as \"ideas\"... and so-on up the abstraction hierarchy until somehow ?consciousness? appears as an emergent behaviour at the top - Perhaps consciousness is the ability not to combine conscious thoughts but to filter all the subconscious hunches down to a single coordinated thought train :-) ? Or is that effectively the same thing ?",

        "comment": "what I got from this interview initially, is that they are having to filter out lots of internet information so that the 'ai' can do better a-b testing,  which is not intelligence.  I in my opinion think you cannot get any artificial intelligence without it having an external purpose, i.e my purpose as a child was to make my dad and mum proud, if I didn't have that even if I only wanted to survive, why would I want to survive?  My eyes are there primarily so I can survive and make my parents proud.  You cannot program a computer to do that, and even if you did, it would be in a way no more superior to a human.\n\nI am under the opinion and it's only an opinion that you cannot make true ai to be benevolent, you can only do a bad job and make it errored and malevolent because you are a utopian and a computer chasing a utopian goal is dangerous and at high risk of error.   You can use semi-ai  to be an amazing A-b tester that keeps working out the different ways to beat cancer, which is an amazing acheivement, but you will never in my opinion be able to create a benevolent true a.i  because true intelligence needs an outside external reason to explore goals and knowledge in an non-utopian solve everything way, this allows an entity to go back to it's origin and think, is this a good thing, or could this as interesting a path as it is turn into a bad think I can't control.",

Imagine Fox News providing its own AI to its audience. THAT\u2019s how you get a dystopia in a very clear way. The alternative at least leaves some room for humans to align more with the ground truth rather than the other way around. I say that an AI should be able to shut down propaganda from any source by the sheer strength of truth and reason.",
