It's so hard to listen to. I hate judging people by superficial things and I don't wanna do it. But I wish he'd do something about it.

You can use it to turn a bullet point argument into an essay. You can use it to extract info from papers, it can code and much more. It feels like you've got a very knowledgeable mentor and powerful workhorse at your side (which does mistakes you still need to pick up). Interacting with it feels like a human - and productive - conversation. I'm convinced ChatGPT5/6 or something similar will  be integrated into the workflow of about every white collar job and I doubt it'll be possible to remain competitive without it in later versions.\n\nThe future will be great with AI like this... unless it's our downfall.",

I am a very novice ML researcher trying to publish more, but there are a lot of big names and big companies (Google, Cohere, Anthropic, etc) trying to be competitive to OpenAI, however the pace at which these guys are pushing products and updates is unmatched. There are a lot of predictions being made on Twitter everyday saying how these developments will usher a newer era of computing, some even predicting an inflection point in human progress. What unique things OpenAI (+ Microsoft) did (vs say, Google which has an equally intelligent set of people and had a headstart in this domain) and if this is really a new age will only become clear in the hindsight, probably with a lot of case studies published on this. Nonetheless, I want to acknowledge that times are indeed interesting and it is indeed upon people in these times on how we steer this going forward.",

For example LGBT, politics, religion\n\nThey then learn from replies to the accounts they follow based on questions. For exammple someone tweets \"Where do I get the best pizza in Liverpool\" and prople repy \"Company A\" or \"Company B\" \n\nIt then uses mathematics to llearn specific users personalities and responses. For example people in London normally answer \"Why get pizza, pie and mash is better\" etc and you can bring terabytes worth of data from milloons of twitter bots over 15 years to build up personalities and responses and create multiple bots\n\nSo we have religous, political (letft and right), sport, technology AI bot accounts\n\nThe problem with this is that this service is sold commerically, so religous groups for example have swamped twitter with the trans obsesson. Pharma have swamped it with the anti vax obsession to cover the fact a $2 UK vaccine waa banned 2 years ago. Right wing political groups have become dominant, for example trump, walls in US. In the UK Boris Johnson getting votes in northern england, brexit and in both countries nationalism \n\nThe companies/organisations paying all the money to use this technology are not the most ethical\n\nTwitter created the  massive leaps in AI around ineraction ie I am not being rude but a sophisticated chat bot by providing terrabytes worth of data\n\nIts easy to program AI or a chat bot to pass exams, that is a marketing ploy, all you need to do is get the developers to input all possible exam questrions. that is not compex AI, that is very effecive marketing\n\nHowever what is happening on twitter and has been for 10 years is absolute genui but equally one of the most dangerous things the world has ever seen as 99.99% of people think they are talkiing to a real person",
