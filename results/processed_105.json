Some may want to give AI motivation to improve itself, that is giving it desire for superiority or supremacy.  If we're going to give an AGI motivation, it is best to wait until it has become wise, until it has demonstrated empathy and compassion.",

I think the thing it is probably best at is writing essays, however, they are horribly shallow and basically just summarise topics, not to mention it is hardwired not to take any kind of stance on any topic that anyone might find objectionable in any way, so it will always equivocate and give false balance to every topic.  It also has a tendency to forget or ignore parameters you give it, its incredibly frustrating to interact with",

I lately, have had an odd train of thought because of this: \"is our mind really just that simple?\" Do we really just begin processing fragments, then spew out predictions of - just what comes next and attempt at nailing the landing? Is that really it, is that all that thought really is?\n\n2 additional things:  \n\n1) I do worry tremendously on the nefarious use of it in the near future in propaganda and the like. For instance, with a bit more advancement and with unethical motives, couldn't it be tooled on current events, political biases, civic stances, issues, etc. and be ordered to render messaging to shape predictable outcomes within society? Sort-of total recall-like vibes.\n\n2) I really really look forward to it's use in medicine here soon. It will save more lives than anything in the history of humanity. The ability to tap all knowledge of a subject without error will be game changing.  Hopefully at a dramatically reducing the costs too.  *(I see some of the biggest companies hiring for these sorts of roles all of a sudden, specifically at the nexus of AI and medicine. I cant help but infer the recent releases of gpt alongside those postings)",

There was a group that was looking at some things GPT-4 doesn't do well and one of them was handling non-sequential tasks.  Humans don't do this particularly well in every case, but when well practiced, we can absolutely do it. \n\nThat all said, I think we are a collection of different routines, and what LLMs seem to be doing is one of those things, and I think once layers are added on top along with more memory and ability to review it's own actions and consequences, it might end up just being almost like us, though a lot smarter and more so once it can start improving itself.  We have no clue on the upper limits of that.",
