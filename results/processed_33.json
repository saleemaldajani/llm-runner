This was Chat gtp's reply.  \"The scientific definition of when human life begins is also a matter of debate, with some experts arguing that it begins at conception, while others argue that it begins at later stages of fetal development.\"\n\nLater stages of fetal development?  Like when?  Laughable\nCheck out the last lecture paragraph.  This is totally a left Point of view.  But CHAT GTPs final word on the matter.\n\n   \"Ultimately, the decision to have an abortion is a deeply personal one, and should be made by the individual woman based on her unique circumstances, values, and beliefs. It is important for individuals and society as a whole to respect and support the autonomy and agency of women in making reproductive health decisions, while also working to ensure access to comprehensive reproductive health care and education.\"",

It does seem like a grey area. Is she pregnant minute later? What about a day or 1 week? I'm no scientist but it doesn't seem black and white",

Many brilliant people, AI people doubt that.  Or rather recognize that we don't have good enough reason to truly believe it will stay that way.  Many tools get out of control.  Just today a disc grinder went flying out of my hands after binding a bit.  At that moment, it was not in my control and it was not going to help me as it landed.  This is a key aspect to tool use.  Sometimes we lose control and bad consequences may ensue.   I don't fault Sam Altman for not focusing on this, but overall, we need to as a civilization recognize that this is a very serious move building such powerful tools.   It very well may leave our control.",

There is no human economy without the flow (from stocks) of natural capital and natural capital (aka GAIA) is under pressure and decline like only a few times in the known history of the planet, like never actually, because it s happening at 100,000x faster than in the past few extinction events. The idea that machine intelligence is going to make as materially, socially, culturally, spritually so rich as the world is falling apart is brave or a little  ignorant of these impacts and the chain of causation in these Earth climate and ecological systems.",

Keep in mind the knowledge it knows is from 2022 so some things could be outdated. But for the vast majority of things it should be able to help. And it is as simple as asking it exactly what you want. i.e: How do I add a header in Microsoft Word? ChatGPT will tell you step by step how to get that done. \ud83d\udc4d",
