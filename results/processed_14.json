I've never used it. \nWhat would happen if two different people asked it identical questions at the same time, would it produce a different result? It's ability to empathize or evaluate its audience at the time seems also fundamental to human intelligence.\nCan it process non English language content without the bottle neck of translating it to English? How the tool operates within a cultural or geographical context seems important, too. \nAt what point will we combine this artificial brain with a sensory system that is devoid of neurological and emotional connections to that brain? Imagine eyes that can see in all spectrums of light, and hear the extreme frequencies of sound waves? Oh and by the way it can actively analyze those two things and create a third combined sensory measurement. That factor compounds again when it can feel via sound pressure levels and taste or smell with static electricity levels of precision. Will it aggregate these inputs to manufacture emotions, maybe averaging that data with the sample data's average emotional reaction to similar events?  \nI'm just afraid that we will exhaust resources with this before it teaches us how to save those resources. We will bite our human experience into tiny pieces attempting to load every granular detail of our realities into this artificial intelligence.   I would argue that a spiritual super power or a surge of love and empathy on this world, would do a lot more than the technological advancements of this tool.",

I know  someone will this is not true or anything, but it is true, when you use it you can realize this. And more important is that this is CENSORED, and the information is in some fields basically completely wrong, I asked a few things about history and economy, gave all the stupid answers normies can give you. For the teacher using this and happy, yeah.... les work for you, not that your work was actually real work since schools are indoctrination camps and the system is repeating dogmas set up by government anyway, not really learning anything useful....but yeah, AI is good for \"exams\" not for learning though. For me, chat GPT, besides the woke censorship, all the political and even DIETS are censored, it's useful to save time, like google and wikipedia on steroids, and technically is the same thing, an information search system, like google. Sure, if you have to search how to code something you will take hours or days using just google, but it is possible. It is true that AI can and will give unique \"no google\" answers, unique answers, but this will be still in the same realm of just feeding you information, just newer and more unique information, and in fact these AI all operate with databases. There will be competition and alternatives to WokeAI.",
