It really does appear to be able to reason, and that reasoning wasn't programmed or designed, but emergent from its training. The one thing it doesn't do is learn in real time. Sure you can have a conversation context, but this isn't the same as being able to change the model in real time. It doesn't have an internal dialogue. Or complex motivations. But this isn't saying it isn't intelligent, only that it isn't like us. Learning in real time though I think is part of true AGI. There are some reasons to believe real time feedback from its own actions is critical to effective efficient learning.",

And CHAT-GPT is very intriguing, even if, after having chatted to it for a few minutes, i wouldn't trust it to make me a cup of tea.  So on with the show...\n\nAfter: oh dear, only 1 minute in and this guy in a designer flackjacket and cracked voice \"i know it all\" smartest guy in the room attitude already turns me off bigtime.  are there any real scientists working on this stuff i can listen to?\n13:21 huh :(  Already into handwaving,,, this fellow is a salesman, not a researcher.  pity.\n20:31 Lex should ask CHATGPT if Jordan Peterson is worth listening to, and if it said it would rather talk to a cabbage, then it could be said to have some reasoning ability",

This abstract creative skill of converting an idea into an automated action is not possesed by most (yet). Obviously now that AI is starting to pop off humans will slowly adopt this skill to transform the best input towards the best output. Coders still have a massive headstart on this building apps on top of openAI API and finetuning / embedding your own text within the model through the API. Prompting is kinda like building a complex function, be creative and use it as an amplifier",

High-powered statistical pattern-matching, i call it.  Chomsky calls it a steamroller! :)",
