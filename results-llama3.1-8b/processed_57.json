        "comment": "Ideal truth is represented as a sphere described by irrational numbers. But you cannot know ideal truth in an irrational way. However, if truth is not represented as a sphere, but as a cube with facets, each facet being a principle, then the dialectical method of knowledge is quite applicable to such a \"figure\". Such a figure is already knowable because it is described discretely, i.e., using the abstract logical component of thinking that operates on the basis of the dialectical method of cognition. The dialectical method of cognition is based on an intellectual activity based on judgments (reasoning), which, as a single process, consists of a chain of inferences logically linking individual propositions and leading to the confirmation of something true or the rejection of something false. The unity of judgments between thoughts (images - irrational entities) is ensured by the unity of the subject under discussion and the logical connections between the parts of the subject under discussion, i.e. it is based on the interaction of the components of human abstract-logical and image-illustrative thinking.\n\nObjective reality is thus knowable through the possibility of reflecting its parts in the process of abstraction. If truth is the most accurate description of objective reality in all its diversity, then there are no right or wrong abstractions. There are more or less viable abstractions. Unfeasible algorithms are fictions and illusions. Therefore, the process of discovering truth (which is actually a spherical approximation of truth) is the process of forming abstractions that most accurately reflect the processes of objective reality. The process of discovering the truth is conditioned by metrological correspondence, which is ensured by man's ability to attribute qualitative and quantitative properties to phenomena, for which the abstract-logical component of thinking is responsible.\n\nSince objective reality is knowable, in order to know it, we must first extract the primary categories from it. \n\nThe multiplicity of objective reality, of all phenomena, can be reduced to primary categories, which, further generalized, give rise to \"everything in general\", i.e. objective reality itself, expressed in one word - \"the universe\".\n\nInformation as a primary category includes both information in general and the algorithms used to transform it. Any change in matter involves a change in the information about it, and such changes follow certain algorithms that are also described by information.\n\nMetrology, as a set of measures, is the scaling of a certain type of information embedded in matter. Therefore, a measure as a set of dimensions is a special informational state of (descriptive) matter. \n\nThe components of the primary categories give rise to the secondary and subsequent categories of objective reality. For the human psyche to function properly, it must have a clear set of categories and a hierarchy of them - their structure, interrelationship, and other criteria. All of this is necessary for the accurate functioning of the components of the psyche, which will be discussed in more detail later. Disregard for Sequences, Priorities, and Other Inconsistencies The presence of these irregularities leads to malfunctioning of the psyche.",

        "comment": "You didn't ask him the main question. If OpenAi is so \"Open\" why did they restrict certain countries from using it? Shows their real faces. They speak like they have very high motives and they are so democratic but in reality they deny certain countries from using Ai and participating in this process of creating AGI basically. So some countries are just excluded just because of politics. This is disgusting. \n\nWith a lot of disrespect,\nnot yours,\n\nAlex from Russia.",

        "comment": "\u200b\u00a0@dewinmoonl\u00a0 Those barriers are being solved rapidly. The granularity of control is being improved daily. Artists have very good reason to be concerned about losing their jobs to someone that uses tools to increase their output. Has it ever been any different? People want to have their cake and eat it too. They want to talk about market forces and merit, well if an artist wants to keep doing things the old way and nobody wants to hire them because they are either unproductive compared to someone else, who you going to blame? The tool that one artist is using and the other isn't. As a former artist that lived through the pre-digital era until now, all I can say to these snobbish art whiners is \"adapt, or die.\" as the saying goes. I for one, don't care one bit for artists that will 'lose out' based on this tech. Back when I was in art school I recall the head of the department saying to our incoming class that not everyone is going to have what it takes to make a living as a professional artist. My feeling is the same for the profession in 2023. If AI takes your job, and you can't find work doing something different, then you aren't making the right choices.",

If you know how to paint and draw and are employable today in March 2023, you should still be employable in March 2024 as you already have excellent skills that are at worse enhanced by Stable Diffusion, Midjourney etc. So you have nothing to fear, in the short term. 5 years from now nobody knows at the pace things are moving. As the rate of progress increases, the less predictable the future becomes in the short term. Hang on tight.",

Is it possible the race to experience personal consciousness and the creation of AGI is the final battle. Will we be doomed to stay on this earthy plane and not move onto the next one? I hope we can handle the use of both equally like the Yin and Yang to just maximize our potential instead of giving up to the computer parent. Thank you Lex.",
