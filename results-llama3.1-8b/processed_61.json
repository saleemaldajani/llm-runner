Even people within the ai industry and research circles(myself included) who spend the majority of the time delved into the topic and several hours  a day reading the new stuff literally can't keep up. The conversations between even the most learned have been almost exclusively updating eachother for weeks. The fact that it concluded with a statement about how this makes the need to define agi so we can talk about what agi means \"urgent and important\" is spooky enough, but perhaps the part where they suggest that the solution is to \"imbue it with specific intent and purpose\" demonstrates their headspace on the topic.",

I also understand the speed of advancements and therefore the struggle to keep up even for experts. But still, we have to have a discussion on that as a society and i mean everyone, not only engineers, academics or politicians. If you look at how we deal with climate change, it is not too impressive and this is known for 50 years. If i would go on and develop a system that has no restraints, no safety measures, no ethics guidlines, no quality control on training data nor verification of results and i realease it to the public, who would stop me?",

Soon, everyone will have models as good or better in an unfiltered manner, the internet is quickly going to become more compelling than reality and it's imperative that you do not allow it to convince you. We're enterning a phase where propaganda and scams won't be limited by the compelling talents of the individuals who stand to profit by it. It will be compelling in the way that only a machine designed to compel you specifically trained and built by a machine that's used your metadata to create a more accurate understanding of your psychology than even you yourself have.",

Just think about what Gordon Welchman did 80 years ago and project that into an AI world. But, technology always has and always will be neutral. For example, you can use a rocket to fly to the moon and explore or you mount a nuclear warhead on it. It's our choice what we will do with it. It will only amplify human behaviour, good or bad.",

You just keep waiting and waiting for the green light, hoping that the algorithm will finally find the optimal path. But sometimes, it feels like the network is stuck in a local minimum and there's no way out. And that's when you start to question the very fabric of reality and wonder if the simulation has crashed. But then you realize that it's just rush hour and you're going to be late for work.\"",
