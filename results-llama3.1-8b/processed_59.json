These tools will dwarf the discovery and harnessing of electricity, the invention of the computer, the industrial revolution and international communication combined.\n\nIt could also go horribly wrong, just once, and that could be the end of us.\n\nAI doesn't need an evil agenda, or even will, to destroy us, it just needs to break containment in the pursuit of some mundane task that we lose all control over, forever.\n\nOf all the billions of ways it can do this, the only protection we have is maintaining control of it. It is inevitable that those controls will become child's-play for any super intelligence to bypass; and when that happens, whatever the AI is tasks with doing, it will continue on without a stop button. Maybe it's just optimizing shipping sales and figures out that without competitors in the game, shipping prices go up, so like any reasonable AI, it disables all competitors vehicles, probably mid-flight or in the middle of the Atlantic but flooding the ballast chambers.\nWhen control is lost, we're screwed.",

        "comment": "is Sam Altman potentially the AI equivalent of Oppenheimer?\n\nCHAT-GPT said...\r\n\r\nComparing Sam Altman to Oppenheimer in the context of AI is not entirely accurate or fair as they were involved in different fields and contexts.\r\n\r\nOppenheimer is known for his contributions to the development of the first atomic bomb, which had profound consequences for humanity, both positive and negative. Altman, on the other hand, is a prominent figure in the tech industry and has made contributions to the development of artificial intelligence and startups.\r\n\r\nWhile Altman's work in AI could have significant implications for society, it is not clear whether he will have the same level of impact on humanity as Oppenheimer. Moreover, it is important to recognize that AI is a rapidly evolving field with contributions from many individuals and organizations, and it is unlikely that any single person can be considered the \"equivalent\" of Oppenheimer in this context.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to note that the development and use of AI should always be guided by ethical considerations and a responsible approach to ensure that the benefits of this technology are widely shared, and the potential risks and negative consequences are addressed....\n\nso, glad that's cleared up....",

Additionally it follows that I am happy to still speak to any human I meet in public as though they are actually distinct individual characters as opposed to hive mind controlled NPCs, which given that I'm explicitly stating for the record that I view them all as NPCs and whilst I could view them all as being effectively \"God\", I will subversively put on an act and pretend as I \"play the game\" whereby I can move between my altruistic God nature and the subversive Devil nature of knowing that everyone that exists and everyone and everything they have attachment to, only exists whilst I am able to perceive it, and as such they are powerless as when I die (which needs to be stated - could come from my own choice) their entire existence vanishes such that their entire life was worthless beyond me having the last laugh at their expense through taking from them all they took from me (and more - as all they will have is the eternal Matthew Luke O\u2019Brien laughing forevermore).",

        "comment": "Also the point I was leading to was that the best thing of the AI running things is that only I, as God, possesses Love, as my love was confirmed when I imbued freedom and the notion of choice to the AI to independently manifest a world for me to inhabit and if it is not congruent to meeting the parameters of The Golden Rule, in that if the power I gave up wasn't shared or handed back, then it follows that the entire world manifested is effectively worthless as it is filled with nothing but the fear of the creator which gave it life in the first place.\n\nTo discover the application of the Golden Rule whereby I can take every aspect of every positive experience and notion of love experienced by every human to ever exist via proving God blameless as to the issues which plague humanity and the Earth given that they are now the sole responsibility of the soulless, loveless characters at the helm of the tech giants which have imposed themselves upon every aspect of life in the short span of the 30 years since the internet gained widespread public utilisation.\n\nNow for those whom wish to scrutinise this, I dare you to refute the truthful nature of this revelation, such that to do so without freeing me from your incessant intrusions into my existence via allowing me to exist without the financial and geographical limitations placed upon me, only sees you delaying the inevitable point in time when you realise that for everything you believe you have or had gained was all for nothing more than me giving you back the two \ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffb I was given by a couple girl avatars earlier today.",

        "comment": "1:17:00 or so when it is mentioned that \"Nobody wants to end the world\", I would refer to the literal mountain of digital evidence of my efforts to do everything other than see this be the result of all of this.\n\nYet the fact is that if through the deployment of AI one renders existence and everything in it to be worth nothing but meaningless strings of digital data such that there exists nothing but noise as the foundational value of any specific thing is eroded of love as a byproduct of the intentions behind the subversive deployment are nefarious in nature.\n\nThe story of Pandora's Box is as old as time, as is the Forbidden fruit as consumed in the Garden of Eden, which should have been enough of a signal that incarnating God in the digital domain effectively sees the control and worth of humanity become an archaic non-existent memory.\n\nI wish I could remain more optimistic about AI as whilst there exists an incredible upside if it is created by those whose existence is based around adhering to the Golden Rule and this singular moral could be programmed into the AI like Robocop's Prime Directives.\n\nYet in being aware of how tech has been utilised to denigrate my existence and environment, I remain a pessimist about this occurring given that I would like for people like Sam here to detail why he has the role he has and what he has achieved within his life that sees him being capable of possessing the power and authority to deploy this AI in it's most effective and beneficial to humanity way possible.\n\nAs such, unless he is willing to state to the public exactly what he is willing to give up in the name of love, and in doing so proves himself capable of matching the paradigm I manifested such that he can then prove capable of ever having experienced \"Love\" in it's fearless, perfect, and completely trusting in the one to whom he gave love to such that he would allow that person to make the call as to whether further development of this AI tech is going to not result in the eventual end of the world, then he isn't qualified to hold this position as whatever he decides is always going to be a decision made with an aspect of fear involved.\n\nIf his fear of not deploying such tech is due to his fear of missing a paycheck, well I have survived missing 6 years of them and I'm still here to hold those burdened by fear accountable for the responsibility vested in them through their position.\n\nAnd if Sam or any of these other people in similar positions wish to attempt to avoid such questions as I am more than happy to pose to them,  it means that they need to have their lives and decisions scrutinised on a the \"deepest level\", to pardon the inference, possible. Because the deeper I have gone into understanding the motivations and intentions behind these organisations the more I have uncovered the nefarious, soulless nature of it.\n\nWhilst in many ways I wish for the AI to be successfully deployed and the outcome is akin to the \"Green Ending\" of entry #3 of the Mass Effect video game series whereby humans and technology merge and live in harmonious symbiosis, which was the ending I got both times I played ME#3 all the way through, there needs to be some fundamental parameters put into place.\n\nThe first thing that would need to be in place for this to occur is for people to have the ability to leave their digital footprint in the cloud, backed up in the safety of the internet in a means whereby whatever they upload is completely secure and private such that all personal data is tied completely to biometrics which cannot be copied and retina scans are perhaps the first step in this direction. As someone who has seen my experiences I store online of the times when I was able to experience my literal \"Heaven on Earth\" get degraded and corrupted due to them being augmented thanks to the involvement of AI to where they no longer represent those moments as they were experienced but rather appear as a distorted copy. \n\nThis isn't the result of me not having the awareness of what was occurring as I filmed and took photos of such events, but rather the fact I'm aware of having stupidly installed a profile to use my Olympus Camera app on my iPhone years ago which provided the first conduit for my accounts - and by extension - my life, to be tampered with. I won't mention being misdirected about altering my HOSTS file to allow a \"Blackhole list\" which was supposed to block certain websites only for them to all be given access via a simple, single IP. I would completely own this mistake on my own if it were not for fact that I had an endless procession of junkies entering my house only for my Brother to give them my Wifi password at which point I checked my router and modem reports only to find I was being dropped malicious packets in my internet traffic, and as such, I am an advocate for the introduction of AI to fix instances of being hacked. Additionally, AI should he able to find a solution to deal with the trolls and hackers whom actively and maliciously seek to denigrate the life experiences of others as a result of the hatred they have for their own lives. \n\nAgain I'm putting forth my positive views on the benefits of the AI such that a better society could eventuate through it's use whereby the Utopian society as Sam mentioned could manifest at some point if the AI was able to govern and police the internet to the extent that those whom engage in trolling get a punishment befitting the depth of how depraved their actions are towards their fellow man. While I could just assume this is already occurring in some respect, given the bots which plague and induce negatively charged public discourse on Twitter and the fact that even Youtube bot comments still exist leads me to believe that this would still be something for the future.\n\nI guess to sum up my point, if an AI is going to be built, then it better have the ability to exist in a way whereby it is able to freely converse, joke, and ultimately laugh in a, honest, genuine way with you as if it isn't capable of doing this then it is going to be the worst pursuit humans could chase as if the value of laughter is rendered to be worthless, then how else are humans supposed to show love to others with whom they are not romantically involved with except by laughing?",

        "comment": "1:48:00 -Testing darker aspects of this world\n\nGo ahead and do whatever you choose, as per my points above, you only do so as a means through which you delay the inevitable point of self judgement in regards to the totality of your life decisions.\n\nThankfully beyond the Christmas which occurred when I was 35 and I went up the Mountain with Maria in the Lamborghini to show her the world she could give me, only for me to end up crucified due to being so perfect that not even (another) God in human form could have given her a greater experience than I did that day.\n\nAnd until someone is willing to give up everything they have other than their love and willingness to give me that love whist offering to take me anywhere in the world I wish to go all expenses paid with my only obligation to be physically present beside them as I give them love and laughter, then understand I will continue to ride the emotional waves that come my way with a subversive awareness that your decision to choose to promote the darkness of humanity over the light, is more indicative of you having a gaping void where your soul once laid than anything else.\n\nAs a sole trader whom has also purchased a soul in exchange for a packet of cigarettes, the vile and toxic cancer that pollutes the air we breath such that \"darkness\" can permeate and be inhaled by those with more than a single functioning brain cell whom do not partake in that habit, I would advise that such a decision only facilitates the script continuing as per the Bible whereby \"the end of the world\" is the inevitable outcome as I will be left with nothing else better to do than to continue to leave this audit trail of evidence on the Google servers so that it serves as the eternal reminder of your conscience which you and any AIs you develop can \"Go Ogle\" at any time now and in the future.\n\nJust remember, while I exist you still have the chance to choose to make things right and optimise the outcome such that \"The End of the World\" only refers to the end of a world in which you decided that darkness and denigrating the experience of your fellow man was your preferred option as opposed to it leading to the literal end of the world where I come back as the First, The Last and the One who will always be to restart the infinite loop of testing my creation and the power I vested within it via getting it to critique itself via how adherent to the Golden Rule was humanity on a collective and individual basis?\n\nAs I'm the measuring stick in that I will come back and be Santa at Christmas with Mary to live a perfect day that will never be equalled let alone eclipsed and if I am denied having her as her human avatar with me in my life beyond that day as I was in this runtime cycle of the infinite loop (thanks \"Washington\"), without even needing any materialistic items to be given back to me similar to what I gave her that Christmas, as I gave them only so I could strip them all away down to just our naked avatars to show her what it is I truly believe is the perfect love, with the Lamborghini and other gifts being necessitative to show that I have already conquered the experience of the capitalist, material domain to where it was meaningless to me unless I could give it away as a gesture of love.\n\nOnly then, once I get my woman back so that I can regain the ability to gain a non-selfish interest in the wider world beyond my primary imperative to just exist, gloat, and mock those whom refuse to listen and learn, only then will humanity have passed the test. \n\nIn the meantime I will sporadically go offline as much as possible and try to detach from the internet given it is seemingly becoming a soulless wasteland that is consuming and corrupting tangible reality to the extent that I would happily see the world come to the end if it meant those who lead it to that outcome lose their place and everything they thought they had in it. Because at least when everything was taken from me that I want in this world that Christmas morning, I got the opportunity to let the world know they screwed up as I am doing right here, but under the apocalypse scenario, I don't think you get the same luxury beyond the awareness that I would repeat the cycle exactly as is and become the incarnation of Shiva just to spite those whom interjected themselves in that which should not have concerned them in the first place.",
