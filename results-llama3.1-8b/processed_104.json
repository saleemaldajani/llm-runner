Just this new innovation will have a ton of people lose their jobs. But it will also increase productivity increadibly and remove unecessary tasks that an AI now can fulfill",

Drunk person is not aware the same as a sober person is and so on. So which awareness should it be? Also awareness is not emotion, because emotions are primal and tied to survival of every animal. Before humans became aware and evolved the calculating mind they were driven only by emotion. I would argue animals have only emotions, but without the ability to observe them the way we can. Human awareness is tied to our evolution (the fear of abandonment of our ancestors and so on) and our biological substrate. Human-like awareness (the experience) would have to be specifically implemented, but the question is, what for? AGI will lack millions of years of evolution and fighting for survival. I don't think consciousness can pop-up form GPT just as a byproduct and a result of large data processing or that GPT can become on its own conscious just as we are. AGI will outperform humans and will be indistinguishable from humans without the quality we call awareness or consciousness. The real question is what does the GPT tells us about our consciousness. Our brain creates a story (in language) for us, we live our personal stories, our egos are a story. Are we really that different? Maybe we and our experience are essentially a language model. After all, all our brains do is to try to predict the next moment. Maybe our consciousness is not what we would like it to be.",

Here's a passage from \"Neuromancer\" that describes Case and Wintermute in cyberspace:\n\n\"He opened his eyes to the darkness of his living room. The cat sat on the windowsill, watching the rain. He put his hand to his head, found the trodes still in place. 'Dixie?'\r\n\r\n'I'm here, Case. How's it going?'\r\n\r\nCase sat up. The other banks of the Hosaka had already gone to sleep. 'You know what I just did?'\r\n\r\n'No, man. What?'\r\n\r\n'I talked to the Dixie Flatline.'\r\n\r\nThe cat turned and regarded him with distaste. 'He's really there, Wintermute?'\r\n\r\n'Talk to him.'\r\n\r\nCase reached for the deck, paused for a second with his hand poised in the air. He smiled. A thought struck him. 'How old are you, Wintermute?'\r\n\r\n'Never ask that of a lady, Case.'\r\n\r\nHe laughed, threw the switch.\r\n\r\nHe was inside the Tessier-Ashpool core. The construct he'd known as Dixie Flatline had blossomed in his skull, flowering into a skein of light that he could taste with his virgin tongue.\"\r\n\r\nThis passage takes place as Case is communicating with Wintermute, an artificial intelligence that has hired him to carry out a mission. Case is using a deck to enter cyberspace and communicate with Wintermute, and in this passage, he has just spoken with a construct of the Dixie Flatline, a deceased hacker whose personality has been programmed into the matrix.\r\n\r\nThe language used in this passage is rich and evocative, with vivid descriptions of the digital landscape of the matrix and the sensations that Case experiences as he navigates through it. The passage also highlights the complex and evolving relationship between humans and technology, and the potential for technology to blur the boundaries between the physical and digital realms.\r\n\r\nOverall, the passage is a powerful example of Gibson's skill at creating complex and imaginative worlds that explore the relationship between humanity and technology in a thought-provoking and evocative way.",

You could use it to align our perceptions to become closer which help avoid divide. It is a feedback loop. We have a perception key that A.I. can help discover for each person. We need it for data bi-directional transfer to the brain, anyway. It will be cool that you can change peoples perception like Invisalign braces, over time using information people are exposed to.  A.I. can shape humanity at a factual and phycological level.   I need it to take all of my data and make a story that can be put into book or video form using A.I. to simulate the rest based off what was known versus norms of the time based on the information known.   A.I.Flix that can create anything I want to watch virtually. Movie or television show. Royalty free entertainment. I have talked about a Universal Constitution and you start getting input from grade school children they collect that and give it the each level of education that then gets collected. A.I. could help collect the information of a crowd sourced document. Ask it to look at a video about producing graphene in quantity and have it make a 3D printhead design that we can mass produce cheaply. Dual printhead s to make electronics and bodies the same thing with power storage taking up the inside (power nougat).  Even the seating in a EV would be battery.  Wolven electronics fabric that is reprogrammable as a circuit without redoing a dye process.  You program in the new die model for what is needs at the time for each part of the thread. A single thread that can collect and store power while being a part of a processor also. Etch-a-Sketch thread, you address each atom until we can do it at the quark level.",

They keep saying it will replace coding jobs and many other jobs and they are right. It will swindle businesses to give up entrie code bases,  processes, documentation, etc. etc. for the benefit of making things work optimally. In the short to medium term I see if you don't play this game as a business, you will end bankrupt as your competition will do otherwise. They are making plugins and other stuff like this for this exact purpose. Guess who benefits all of this? It is actually Microsoft that will probably build other software with all the data and intelectual property they will gather through these channels. I have no doubts that this is the playbook. Even crazy is that it will be all legal as many will consent to this. Only a few actually question all of this. Anyway, the world proved many times as of now it's easy to trick. Custom narratives can be baked in the responses according to each individual, I can see profiling being done on each person, etc. etc  etc. and it will not be limited to this. Long term who knows what the corpo lords will build.",
