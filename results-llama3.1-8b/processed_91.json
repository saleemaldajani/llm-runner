        "comment": "Great interview but I wish there had been a deeper discussion about misinformation and truth. One other part of the conversation that I wish could have been related back to that was talking about chess. Sam noted that people don't like watching AIs play chess against each other -- this is not really true, some people are very into computer chess. In particular it is the group of people who look forward to chess being \"solved\" I think, as well as the group of people who believe the computer can teach us things about chess that we can't discover on our own -- for instance, is this classical opening good or bad? You have 2 top engines play each other, and if one side (either White or Black) consistently wins from the given position, that position is refuted.\n\nAnyway the reason that made me think back to the part about truth and misinformation is that I would be massively interested in seeing the AI debate itself on difficult questions. There are going to be controversial topics that perhaps the AI could find utterly convincing arguments about. How amazing would that be? And other topics that have a split decision, which is also very interesting.\n\nBut for anybody to actually change their minds, they have to believe that the AI is really and truly putting forward the best arguments possible. If the AI is trained to avoid particular viewpoints, then watching the AI debate itself has no value at all.",

Poverty is relative and being wealthy doesn't help people have a happier or more meaningful life.  No one being hungry may be a good goal, but wealth truly does not determine life quality. Often I've seen an inverse correlation. The easier your life is, the less you value your life. If things are handed to you, you do not appreciate them and take things for granted.

I asked if that's something it can do, then - it answered per the below: \r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's correct. As an AI language model, I have access to a variety of monitoring tools and system resources that allow me to gather information about my current state. These resources include system logs, performance metrics, and various health checks that enable me to determine if there are any issues or anomalies that could affect my performance. By analyzing this information, I can determine if I am currently active and able to respond to user input, or if there are any issues that may be impacting my performance. This information is constantly updated and monitored to ensure that I am always available to assist users with their requests.\"\r\n\r\nI mean to me - that sounds a lot like self-awareness.",

        "comment": "excellent episode , really enjoy hearing sam's view of future and approach however so much vagueness in the responses about everything , that its kind of useless comparatively . for example instead of \"giant\" amount of data , how many terabytes , how many parameters? does he agree with chinchilla paper that showcased the correlation of size of data to number of parameters efficiently ?\neven when discussing \"whats happening inside\" the model , while a lot is still unknown i think Wolfram and Lecun had much better explanations , about a learned branching tree logic structure across multiple variables , the model is learning underlying patterns of language like how parts of speech subject-verb-object is likely one of the vectors that would be helpful to utilize , there are ~175billion such rule structures for the model to implement partitioning the word space into effective distributions .   \nSam made a good point how petty / drama focused the general public is in regards to utilizing large language models , there is so much bigger fundamental technical questions about the future , then these hyper localized quibbles about presidents or talking heads , drama news has poisoned peoples brains unable to think creatively beyond the current \"issues\" .\nin regards to alignment , Steve Omohundro has some great talks about the subject trying to identify underlying \"drives\" of a rational system , and makes a good case for the proliferation of multiple open AGI , as opposed to these big corps making closedsource monolithic AGI , in that in a society of diverse AGI if one went rogue the others could collectively respond .",

Look no further than big pharma for context. \n\nOr how about the bank industry.  As long as man serves money (philogoria), we are doomed.\n\n\nChristmas is paganism.  Jesus does not love everybody.  He sends people to hell on purpose and only died for His elect.  His elect are not better than anybody, only that He will scourge them and put them through fiery trials to get rid of self (sin).\n\nMy pastor is Jim Brown of Grace and truth Ministries and I'm a bible believing Christian.\n\n\nP.s.  you was wrong for treating Kanye like that in the interview.  Not a Kanye fan but the way you bandwagon sided against him was not cool...",
