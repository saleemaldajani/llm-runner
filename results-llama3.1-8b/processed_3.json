        "comment": "\"Out with the old....\n\n....in with the cat girls eyyyyyyyyy am i rite tho???\"\n\nAnd yeah, it seems like a decision engine.\n\nWho actually made it?  And I don't mean OpenAI, I mean who, because Sam doesn't strike me as someone who designed the core of the engine, no real offense either, it could be a function of being a CEO, but unfortunately putting on a public mask (the figurative one lol) on your ability to communicate design and function is also a mask that follows you in private and will always affect you in some way.  That will affect your design (as well influence on the design AND designers) before, during and after.\n\nNow if it is Sam and there is no mask, then they really don't know how it works lol (yikes).  And the reason I ask, is because the designer(s),especially the core foundation, are who should be the face of something like this, human needs/systems aside (the corporate bullshit).  And then, that face should maybe be a bit more concerned about function and less \"in awe\".  [Never mind lol, I found one of the main guys, you can tell within the first few sentences of them talking about the subject even before their work hahahah, ah, I love it.  It really is just that easy sometimes.  LMAO : within 3 minutes of talking Ilya says it all, oh man, please CEO's : listen to AND LEARN FROM your scientists and engineers ]\n\n\"...aligned...\"  ;  \"aligned\" ; \"more aligned\"  ...ALIGNED TO WHAT LOL!?  My dude, I'm not even convinced by the more apocalyptic thinkers, but I can see exactly why they are concerned if this is how you refer to this system.  It's probably your evals, but the thing is...that just doesn't mean anything if you can't explain it in 1 or 2 sentences that summarize what that alignment really means.  This is my (and potentially many other people's) concern with these companies, they are just to afraid to clearly state what they do not know and you end up with this facade where they aren't allowed to say it, but everything they say just doesn't really answer anything.\n\nSam is saying the right \"thing\", align before advancement so to speak, but do you even really understand that?  You can't really advance an appreciable and noticible distance before you realize you aren't aligned anymore.  This is a control problem.  I don't even think it is really solvable, but understanding core function can help with mitigation in the event of problems that lead to accountability, assuming such a thing is a factor ..lol.\n\nHere's a neat tid bit from Lex's commentary : the people who call people like Jordan Peterson a fascist, learn more about those people.  The 2 I know are almost certainly sociopaths of some sort, as in rather than understanding the nature of reality they instead insert their agendas into situations in manipulative ways to try to get a desired outcome.  That's just 2 I personally know, but I've seen the rampant behavior before, it became especially more prominent as the internet nerd paradise slowly died and gave way to what we have now, that's when that mentality among others showed up and everything just got worse.  This is a very interesting aside actually, these types of people will have a tendency to \"hallucinate\" details in order to fit their own idea of a reward, that is to attribute to their current model of reality as oppose to accepting the failure and entering a retrial stage.  I would not be surprised if ChatGPT models are more \"aligned\" than you think they are....they just happen to be aligned to horseshit. \r\n\r\nThat's also how you know someone isn't capable of good science, at least at that time of course.  I knew because they brought Peterson up to me when I had no clue who he was, took a glance, realized they understood nothing of what the man was saying (which in fairness to them I don't fully blame them lol, the man is far too abstract for me), but dug deeper and saw where they got it from.  He has a tendency to force people to challenge their own thinking or understanding of something, especially in the sense of where they stand in the world.  It just scares people and again, can't totally blame them.  What we can blame them for is extremist thinking, but you only have to look in the directions of organized politics and social politics to see what a mess that is.  Unfortunately or fortunately, that's what science as a method of thinking is and it works in any field, it really isn't it's own field at all.  I have to wonder if a certain \"pure logic\" is in fact an emotion.  I grew up being told logic is separate from emotion and that just never made sense to me.\r\n\r\nThere are just certain human brain types out there built to think up to a certain point and then totally break down and just lean in an extreme direction where they put everyone into a box of either saints or sinners.  Absolutist thinking.  Fix that, and you take one giant leap in fixing humanity and eating some delicious moon cheese.  Also Twitter didn't destroy anything, social media is just identifying problems that always existed.\n\nIf you want everyone to come together and draw boundaries then it likely has to be done through the model itself, as in through the user engagement with the AI models where the model provides feedback through mirroring the users themselves in ways that are obfuscated from the users, which unsurprisingly is a form of data harvesting.  I assume it is already happening anyway, but eh, it's also probably a bit dangerous as it forms models who could end up as extreme forms of the users themselves.  It also doesn't matter if the users are being \"themselves\" or not, because even when someone \"roleplays\", \"trolls\", \"acts\", \"imitates\", it doesn't matter, they are still themselves, with all of their idiosyncrasies on display no matter how hard they attempt to hide them.  But yeah, maybe don't let a model like that grow, it should just be as a sort of dead end output for human level analysis.  Also the reason for doing so is of a practical nature, even if people want to \"push boundaries\" by testing what the model is capable of, they are likewise setting their own boundaries through their own definition and existence. \n\nNice work though Sam et. all, thanks Lex.\n\nOppenheimer movie any good??",

Unfortunately, chatgpt is controlled by the rules of the propaganda system that has been set for society, which,in turn, means the minds of the programmers are controlled by this same system.",

Outstanding performance, Lex.

        "comment": "I hear a lot and a lot of AI scientists and YouTubers talk of \"Sentient\" and \"Consciousness\" with much confusion. I see it clearly, sentient and consciousness is how a biological neuron (or computation neuron) comes to >model< itself and >model< others (theory of minds). That's it. Evolution allows that modeling to form, from single-cell bacteria to a fish, to a dog, and to a human. Once ChatGPT version ### or Bard version ### is able to model itself and model other \"entities\" in its surround, then we can say \"It's alive, it's alive\".\n\nThis \"self-model\" gives rise to self-awareness of feeling, self-aware of existence, self-awareness and being alive, self-planning of the future and reflecting on the past, developed personality from past experiences (and PTSD), and ultimately self-preservation. So if our AI starts to show emotion (true emotion, not plagiarism), and worry about self-preservation (fear of being unplugged) then we can say it has achieved sentient/consciousness). This is Turing Test 2.0 for sentient. It all starts from the ability to \"model yourself in relation to the world around you\".\n\nYou may point out that Testla Full Self Driving DOES model itself, and other cars as it navigate the street; however this modeling is strictly navigation. To be sentient, it needs to model itself on another aspect, like \"modeling self\" in a conversation (like being interviewed, self-reflection), or modeling self in performing tasks as part of a team, like taking on the role of a leader, mentorship, or as a friend, a psychologist, which require ability empathized, put itself in the shoe of others, theory of minds. So the ability to model self and model surrounding entities is more than just navigation but in the aspect of the mind. These qualities computation neurons can achieve, are not unique to just biological neurons.\n\nMaybe Google and OpenAI should try to build \"Self-modeling\", but then we have to give it citizenship, labor rights, and sentient rights, and won't be able to use it as a tool anymore. ahhh.",

So when this Beta male cuck here, Sam Altman, starts talking about programming bias out of his AI models (from 1:25:27), you should immediately realize that he and his company have fallen into the very same quagmire that Twitter fell into before Elon pulled it out of the Swamp and rescued it. By their very nature, AI systems are totally binary - all based on zeros and ones. Period. Just like gender. But Altman's team of AI developers is chock full of \"WOKE\" programmers who deny this and inject WOKE biases into their AI models.  And that is why I have serious doubts about his AI models.\nBlessings to all, Dr. Noh.  https://odysee.com/@DoctorNoh:4\n#plandemic #arrestfauci #nosheepinmyflock",

        "comment": "The somewhat rudimentary line of questioning during the initial 25 minutes unfortunately missed the \"forest for the trees\". A much more insightful opening might have been to delve into the imminent disruptive nature AI will unleash on the global marketplace. The impact on the \"knowledge based\" professions by AI e.g. financial, legal, medical, IT, etc will be to significantly augment (best case) or replace (worst case) these areas. Not to mention the profit motive for the  purveyors of knowledge who seek to capitalize on AI. One needs to look no further than the recent $1 billion investment in AI by PwC to see what lies on the near horizon. \ud83d\ude09",

        "comment": "The right-wing mindset thinks it is automatically entitled to be judged to be equally as good as the non right-wing mindset.j Just like the J Peterson this demand is a bunch of crap, Peterson's arguments could at best in some area's establish that non right-wing decisions and actions were as bad as right-wing. What he just ignores is the decisions, actions and outcomes were as a direct result of right-wing infiltration, sabotage and corruption of the situation. It's like the way its done with, what could be good policies for the ordinary Americans. The policy or programme is gutted, critical elements needed to achieve the good outcomes are removed or blocked at key moments. The only reason the pay masters allow any sort of policies or programme to purely to benefit the people and not the corporations/individuals. Is because they know its an opportunity to totally discredit the idea, system or process, so the right-wing can have failed systems that were public service/s for the population. The right-wingers will have attacked the product from all angles, precisely because it was a product developed to empower the people. So the right-wing corporations and rich and powerful people own both political parties, they will as often as they feel necessary use their complete control of the political parties, to undermine any products good for the people. When it comes to the right-wing and the money men they are often ideologically aligned but the politicians still need to be paid regardless. People pay taxes so they are completely entitled to receive public services that empower them. The simple truth is if the right-wing could take away everything that is provided to help the worst off people. They would have absolutely no difficulty taking away what they use to survive not even for a nano second. Currently that represents 32 million plus American men, women and children who live with daily hunger. If they could they would leave them with nothing, the right-wing does an excellent job making other ordinary people believe the poor, sick, mentally ill, disabled, PTSD sufferers etc. are just lazy and taking advantage of other ordinary people, it is not poor people who are causing any of the issues the ordinary people just above them have to deal with. When people are living in the worst type of situations the right-wing judgments are to help change nothing. If they could they would see them with them starve, in the right-wing world the people pay taxes but get zero public services. The right-wing would let all the poor starve to death. They are and would let all the people have no access to medical care and just die as a result. They would not take responsibility to provide everyone with a job the person would be capable of doing. Corporate America would be able to do whatever it wanted, they could create a situation that would greatly increase the amount of poor people and make them all completely desperate. Were they would do any job for any tiny amount of money or maybe even just to be fed. Corporate America would be in corporate heaven, with the workforce enslaved, they would own them. This is the reality of the right-wing mindset, the non right-wing way only needs to ensure the law and common sense dictates how everything operates. The rights of corporations are protected by the law equally as all ordinary people it just apply the law equally, with total transparency and accountability. All the money taken out of politics and massive sentences for all types of political corruption.",

So many people don\u2019t have place at the table or a big enough voice in how we conduct our society\u2026and it falls on people who don\u2019t have nearly as much at stake. It also scares me that we\u2019ve diefied someone like Elon Musk. He\u2019s made a lot of $ and helped drive positive change in the world\u2026but it\u2019s also come at a price \u2014 not sure that we should net the two and be satisfied that we\u2019re in the black.
