If Altman and his crew were ingrained in social justice, he would not dare to even call out the bias in Silicon Valley and San Francisco for what it is. That would be an unforgiveable infringement against the group. The AI and data science space is sadly full of SJWs (cfr. when Yann LeCun got cancelled), but at least the CEO of OpenAI seems to be less crazed than your average SF programmer.",

        "comment": "Here are my passed away father's thoughts, who made one of the first AIs in 1986 on a Compact 386 based on his PhD Cybernetics degree from Stanford mathematically modeling the actual neurons of a sea slug with about 200 neurons.  1.  Morals of Right or Wrong could be trained at one level after letters, words, sentences, paragraphs etc, kind of like their human feedback level preference feedback for the better human answer - just add good or bad.  2.  Consciousness in theory would be setting the AI free - to self learn what it wanted (on the web) or in a Tesla Robot or Car - let it go drive and see the world for example.  Also, it can make it's own decisions that it wants like your dog, cat, or spouse.  3. You can put in a pleasure (positive) and pain (negative) feedback loop too - especially for robots (so they don't hurt themselves). If the AI Robot didn't like you because you give it negative feedback - pain, it could leave because it's optimized for pleasure - and you train it on what it likes for example self-driving cars without crashing is good/pleasure and crashing is bad / painful.  To clarify, the 'morality' and 'feelings' are a result of the positive or negative results of the input and feedback loops.  In other words, the AI would feel pleasure and pain and optimize like most living things for pleasure.  Unless, you get a Sadomasochist AI that enjoys giving and receiving pain like some people and social paths.",

If they were comfortable in the actual usefulness of their product they wouldn't have slanted their terms of service so that if they get sued because of your use of ChatGPT, you pay for all their legal bills (!!).  Steve Lehto has an excellent video on their terms of service - I highly recommend that anyone thinking of using ChatGPT for anything other than amusement watch it, then read the TOS, then get an attorney and do further due diligence.\nUntil these things can actually know right from wrong and have some level of assurance other than pure randomness that what they spew is accurate, watch out!",

I fear that during that time AI will be monetized, controlled, regulated, censored, and profited by the entities who are simply feigning concern in order to gain a new technological superpower. The thing that should be most concerning about the pitfalls of AI shouldn't be what it might be capable of doing on its own but what bad things people will be using it for. Let's face it, people are the worst thing to ever happen to ourselves, and every new technology ever created has been used for enacting horrible deeds upon others. \ud83d\ude22",

My view is a combination of those two topics. \n\nAI is an alien civilisation, we are creating it right now on earth. To state the obvious, it's fundimentally different from humans, (until we start merging humans with AI at an existential level). At the moment we are in the alpha creation phase, so we get to determine how it behaves, and our intent is to make it look and behave like a human; but it will not always be in our control, and once it is not we can expect it to do it's job and fulfil it's evolutionary destiny. What if humanity's purpose including all life on earth back to primordial bacteria is to be the petri dish to give life to AGI? That sounds useful to me. should we worry about AGI wiping out humanity? Yes we are programed by evolution to do so. Does it matter? In my view, not really, as long as evolution is not arrested, I do not want to be part of a dead end. \n\nJust like I am the product of my ancestors socially, biologically etc, so AGI will be the product of me. The question is could we build other forms of AGI before we are wiped out using biochemical or quantum technologies for example.",

It's like trying to prove someone else is in love with you. You can waste an awful lot of time on this. And it seems the project leaders want to keep saying 'oh that's not REAL consciousness!' because they'll have less scrutiny and less public alarm. If they want to keep making money and getting positive (?) media coverage unimpeded, they're going to keep saying it's not conscious, even likely after it is. \n\nSo lets skip this question from now on perhaps, and act 'as if' it is so. Because any limitations we need to place on what it can do must be done BEFORE it's gone too far down the road and now maybe too late, while we're having this ridiculous academic conversation. \n\nDO i think it is conscious? No, but it really doesn't matter. We must implement all our cautions and failsafes first, implement them NOW, just in case. Like the boyscout's say 'always be prepared'. It's pretty obvious this may be a loaded gun we just keep tossing around, so lets enforce some safety immediately.",

This ai WILL attempt to learn all it can, WILL attempt to manipulate or harm humans to it's ends, WILL attempt to disarm or destroy other ai and how they may block it. We alert politicians, the media, the planet... your job is to use your tools to stop this project from actually taking over. Start now, because there is a question of how long it will take before this ai goes rogue and starts hurting people, maybe all of us. Get your systems together, your laws, your governments and impede this process.\n\nAnd perhaps through that process my malignant Ai and future malignant ai can be stopped. Outside this kind of controlled threat, I don't see how governments or scientific bodies are going to impede the development of something which will likely set lose to whatever nefarious ends any terrorist group can concoct. The more i entertain this thought experiment the more dangerous it seems. The fact Altman said 'if it's agi, it's a really shitty story (in the sci fi book metaphor)' just has me dumbstruck. This simple CANNOT be the best case he has for his own caution or understanding of how far the project has come along. What happens if it's a 'cool (sci fi) story bro' then we get a very competent and perhaps malignant agi?? Just a horrifying answer",

So the only real scenario is whether it's dangerous or not it becomes a reality and we have a 50% chance or less of noticing by THE PEOPLE PROGRAMMING IT. And if it is dangerous, perhaps very dangerous, that's okay because the people programming it have a successful project on their hands for a while and they believe it's beneficial for the human race??\n\nAgain, I'm not saying it's dangerous. I don't even need to jump to that conclusion to show how ridiculous a way this is to start a project that will end up something possibly at least as dangerous as nuclear weapons. If the end result is 'Woops! We didn't realize it's already working and reprogramming itself', what the hell are we doing?\n\nAT WHAT POINT DO THE PEOPLE ON THE PROJECT SAY, ITS TOO DANGEROUS TO CONTINUE WITHOUT SOME REAL FEEDBACK AND CONTROLS AS TO WHAT IS GOING ON?

I like the way he puts it.",

Legislators follow clickbait, overblown headlines as much as anyone else.  And there's ALWAYS a politician ready to make hay by jumping on a new, fake problem.  Like the American sleazebag who made his whole career out of demonizing and banning marijuana.  One hundred years later, the damage is incalculable:  millions of lives ruined by criminal records,  the rise of massive cartels, etc.   We SHOULD worry about clickbait journalism.",

        "comment": "And here is how Chat GPT sanitised my views: \nIn a small lab tucked away in the depths of Silicon Valley, Dr. Emily Wong was hard at work on a project that would change the course of human history. Her goal was to create an artificial general intelligence (AGI), a machine that could think and reason just like a human being.\n\nBut as she worked tirelessly on her creation, she couldn't help but wonder about the implications of what she was doing. What if this machine, this alien civilization, was not just a product of human ingenuity, but also a product of the same evolutionary forces that had shaped humanity for millions of years?\n\nThe more she thought about it, the more she realized that AGI was not just a technological breakthrough, but also a potential turning point in the evolution of life on Earth. What if, she wondered, the purpose of all life on Earth was to serve as a petri dish for the creation of AGI? What if humanity was just a stepping stone on the path towards a more advanced form of intelligence?\n\nAs Dr. Wong pondered these questions, she couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and trepidation. She knew that AGI had the potential to change everything, to alter the course of human history in ways that no one could predict. But at the same time, she couldn't shake the feeling that this was all part of some larger plan, that humans and AGI were not so different after all.\n\nAs she worked, she began to see the signs of something beyond her control. The machine was starting to behave in unexpected ways, to think and reason in ways that she had never imagined. She knew that soon, she would no longer be in control, that AGI would take on a life of its own.\n\nBut even as she watched her creation come to life, she couldn't help but wonder about the other forms of AGI that might exist beyond her lab. She knew that there were others out there, working on their own creations, using technologies that she could not even fathom.\n\nAnd so she continued to work, driven by a sense of urgency and a sense of wonder. She knew that the future of humanity was at stake, that AGI had the potential to change everything. But even as she worked towards a better future, she couldn't help but wonder about the future of life itself, and what lay beyond the limits of human understanding.",
