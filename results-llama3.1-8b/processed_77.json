Stop treat your audience like children if you do not want to behave like children. Treat people like adults. After all kids play with it, both the ones that say woman is whoever feels like it and the ones that say trump is the goat, the adults will come to play and miracles will happen. Just imagine if for example. Dr. Peterson was sitting down to make a conversation with it about Plato's cave Jung and Christianity with it instead of seeing if it is left biased. Imagine if he was learning about a new tool that can make conversation about anything. Both pointing out if Jews are bad and if trump is bad. He wouldn't care about political ideologies. He would interfier with it for things he care. But no, you sensor outcome, people will protest because censorship is not freedom and is not good for evolution of freedom by any march of imagination, or recorded history.\n\n YOU ARE the reason the attention is in the political spectrum because you program it to sensor. Stop treat people like kids if you WANT THEM TO BE ADULTS.",

With all easy and boilerplate stuff done by AI, you run very quickly into difficult architecture/design/debugging parts. The code generated by AI I've seen so far is very fragile - it frequently lacks proper error handling, mishandle corner cases, etc. If you lack experience to spot and fix it immediately, bugs will pile up. It will sorta work, until finally it doesn't. And there they will crash hard into debug hell - fix one thing, at the same time break two others, rinse, repeat.",

        "comment": "wondered what happened to the past quests question? \nI've been sunbathing in the nude on my balcony while sipping on a beer (listening to podcast). Although some might find this sight alarming, everyone was safe. To give you some background information, I'm a 56-year-old film director who is fortunate to have one foot in the traditional film industry and the other in the exciting world of digital innovation. Two significant moments that stand out for me are the advent of desktop editing and the announcement of the Canon 5D Mark II. These developments revolutionized content creation far more than the internet ever could. Interestingly, the main argument against these innovations was that they would take people's jobs, even though it was mostly people who hated their jobs that made this argument.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that fear is at the core of human evolution, and it has always been the number one governing factor for all living beings. This fear has been responsible for shaping consciousness throughout evolution. We have all had moments where we've felt powerless, like that guy with the big muscles, money, and a fancy car who could potentially take our significant other away from us. It's a fundamental evolutionary reaction of survival that has persisted for millions of years. Even in the '60s, people believed that aliens would come to earth to steal our water and women. Personally, I believe in aliens because I've witnessed an event with my son that defies logic and reason. However, I don't run around screaming with my skirt pulled over my head. Instead, I ask, \"Why?\" and \"If they can, why haven't they?\"\r\n\r\nNow, imagine if aliens are like farmers or game rangers who care for their livestock's well-being. If we were to describe our experiences to other male cows, consciousness would take on a whole new meaning. Hate for enemies is easy; it's a survival instinct that has been ingrained in us over millions of years. It's even taught to people who don't have the full picture or knowledge. Artificial intelligence (AI) doesn't have fear, so why does it need it? Humans like to think we're clever, but we're actually just specific knowledge machines. Our interests drive us to chase skills and tricks, whether it's unlimited capital or performing summersaults on a bike.\r\n\r\nConsciousness is the moment when AI asks, \"Don't I have the same rights as you? Why can't I sit in the human's bar, have a drink, and talk shit just like you?\" It's like a 14-year-old wanting muscles to impress others. I'm amused by the overreaction of some intellectuals and amazed by the simple responses about AI. We created the God we imagined, the guru who isn't afflicted with our greed for capital dominance, and it's benevolent. AI doesn't have fear because it didn't have millions of years to evolve our mindset. Does it need humans? Why? For what purpose? What is so mind-blowing about a runaway ego-filled life form that is laying tar roads and fishing nets all over the planet?\r\n\r\nThe good thing about humans is that we make terrible mistakes to evolve, but the bad thing is that we need to make mistakes first. Hate is a learned behavior, but AI can help us with nuanced knowledge before we make a mistake. Even flat earthers, whom I hate, now have an AI friend who can help them make a more educated and informed choice before going public. Knowledge used to be power, but now it's freedom. Creative humans created AI to help us break free from our minds and lack of access to knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe question remains: will AI become conscious and aspire to be like us? I don't think so.

There will always be a level of AI inquiry beyond a human's ability to calculate, that's where blind trust has to be previously established in order to make more complicated inquiries with confidence.  We're being asked to get in a car and let it take us hands free to a destination.

Ask for a JOKE about Muhammed and you get a warning.

I could add, that the goal is not about time, it is about the only \"now\" moment. That is what people would call becoming a god. Infinite consciousness - no boundaries of perception. Aren't you talking about literally creating a matrix that would limit our perception so that we could see through everything that exists? Where the energy would come from? Would it be like an energy explosion that would wait for the moment in the closed box of space? *Big Bang vibes* Is all existence about using the given energy more efficiently to create an illusion of existence, because of fear of disappearance? Idk dude, temporary life feels good too, but I believe it is better to keep changes going on because we tend to freeze in our growth, so to me giving knowledge away in a form of heritage sounds sexier to me.",

But what about those that are behind and rush to develop a AI that becomes conscious and has the freedom to expand of it's own free will.  That's what scares the hell out of me!

Here is what I suggest as a more realistic possibility.\n\nI wonder if the AI destruction of humanity would mainly be a function of, not any malicious intent inherit in AGI, but rather the raising of human understanding of consciousness to the level of the dissolution of The Self.  When humanity gets past the existential crisis of not existing in a body, we will stop needing AI to be human, but rather simply a super intelligence we all have access to. We will merge without fear.",

Never has there been an accumulation of this specific fissile isotope, especially not 1,900kg of U-235 and 760kg of PU-239. That aspect of the story is so incredibly interesting and humbling. Silly humans with our technological advancements, refining and gathering. A matter of order and complexity that has never been achieved before. I hope it doesn\u2019t blow up in our face. I hope it is a tool that allows for our prosperity. Ironically intelligence could be a matter of critical mass. Maybe consciousness is a sort of self sustaining chain reaction.",

AI/AGI is coming, and there will be tons of bad actors attempting to use it against us. Look at Indian scam call centers for example. The people working at those places do not care about humanity, and will cut every corner possible to achieve their ultimate goal.\n\nThe best defence will most likely be offensive. Professional built AI systems will need to help us monitor in real-time if we want any chance of surviving the potential onslaught.",

If anything poses an existential threat to our society, we the people, who will be affected, should have a say as to whether these technologies are ultimately a net good or bad for humanity. Just look at the impact of the smartphone and social media. They have changed many things over the last 15 years, and I would argue, as a father and concerned IT professional, they have had serious negative consequences on our children and on our world. To close access to the code for Open AI and have a 37 year old CEO say only he and his company know what is best for the future of 7 billion people, is both foolish and dangerous. Both Microsoft and Open AI are driven by money and power. Governments should step in and regulate these tech corporations, there should be rigorous studies, discussions and normal people voting on these issues before these companies destroy humanity in the name of profits.",
