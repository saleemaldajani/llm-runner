You really think there is something that is NOT choreographed? There is not a single thing that is NOT calculated. But still, they are human. And you need to look for these glimpses of humanity that eventually sip through.. in case of this guy, he lost his mask for a sec there when Lex said something positive about Sam wanting to travel to talk to the people about AI and be open to suggestions and he vehemently corrected him: \"oh no no, I'm going to travel to talk to the developers\"... That's what he truly thinks about you and your opinion on the matter. Too bad he's playing with things he doesn't understand and the consequences might be global. If that's not the most arrogant, egocentrical / sociopath think one might do, I dont know what is. F this guy. He's beefed up version of Zuckenberg.",

Due to the aforementioned fiduciary duty, they can even go to jail if they were proven to purposely misrepresent or hurt their business with what they say or what they do. Considering all of this and how much money is all the line, it's baffling anyone takes seriously anything they say. You can only look for the cracks in their masquerade  to find something meaningful about them and glimpses of truth - and his show what usually can be seen - arrogance, narcissism and blind belief in oneself. In case of this guy, also egoism because if something goes very wrong, we are all f*cked. And the optimistic scenario is that labor market map is going to completely change. But hey - he is doing it for our greater good of course! And huge quality of life improvement! To quote SIlicon Valley TV series: \"to make the world a better place\" ;)",

That said, I don't believe it takes away from the innovations achieved with GPT, there's still much to learn in the \"report\" they released, maybe further learnings can be applied to the leaked lambda model (which was even more caged up) or a new architecture.

It might stimulate people to look at the broader picture who are up to this malfeasance, and the money funding it.  The commoners who are paying attention are hoping Elon Musk will have a counter.  That they understand from what he said, why he pulled out of GPT. It became compromised from day one.  He got fooled and figured out the path they are taking (we see now) with AI. He has said it could destroy everything. Bold statement. The \u201cmasses\u201d and the world are discovering these vagabonds want to control it all. And the masses will come to their own conclusions. However, will they have the balls to stop the tyranny fomenters.",

Chess is a game that people play and watch for entertainment. Companies will always prioritize AI over humans if it means enhancing their skill to generate revenue. For instance, if an ability to play chess is generating revenue for them, they would prioritize using AI over human players.",

Fails miserably in the 'intelligence' department, unless you like reading propaganda at the 8th grade level. It is amazing for how fast it can write blocks of code, and that will let India completely take over high- tech, with their lower meat-space human labor cost structure, but call it 'intelligent'? Nope! Call it a 'chat' app? Nope. Call it a stock picker? Nope! Call it a scientific research aide? Nope!",
