ChatGPT predicts what ideas come next and expresses those in a coherent way that makes sense to human users, just like text autocomplete predicts what words should come next. Beyond that, how are they different?",

He's just like \"we're all gonna be rich!\"\n\nIf you can code something in a couple hours that used to take 2-3 people a week, how are those other people getting wealthier? \n\nYou can apply this to probably most fields where people are using computers to do mundane and monotonous tasks. Accountants, bank workers, tax preparers, assistants, next up is developers, animators, computer security firms, on and on. \n\nSo when 1 person and chatgpt can get more work done than 20 humans in a day,   how is this making society more wealthy?  \n\nChatgpt better solve greed, because i dont think the people using it to be 1000% more productive are going take the extra money and give it away to the millions of people who cant keep up. \n\nThis is disruptive as fuck, people trust those at the upper echelons of society to fairly distribute the wealth?\n\nOn the bright side i would expect a slow transition. If everyone started 'the adoption' now, there would be so much displacement that it would seriously affect the global economy. How many % of all jobs can be augmented or replaced with just this iteration of gpt?  \n\nUBI is now on the horizon, for some reason i dont think that will make the masses wealthier.",

Other thing is Lex ask questions about things that are both misleading and about topics he doesn't even understand, for example Lex ask Sam if GPT-4 is counscious, Sam replies he doesn't believe it to be so, and asks the same question in reply so Lex, then Lex doesn't even have a definition or a wild guess about what is counsciousness, so why would you ask something that don't even understand at a basic level (let aside the fact that the topic of counciousness is very controversial as it is its definition). That kind of low quality of questions can very easily lead to wishful thinking, which is something I found Lex has with respect towards AI and technology in general in this and previos interviews.\nAside from that, I liked a lot of the answers and the tone of them Sam gave.",

AI will make the impact of social media seem like a ripple in a pond. I foresee devastating effects.  With respect to the US, academics at the grade and high school levels have declined year after year for decades.  Students are getting worse at reading, math, science, etc.  The ability to critically \"think\" about a problem, a statement, a news story, etc.,  is eroding to scary lows.  Now comes along a technology that can be trained by much more clever individuals to convincingly lead these same people who rely upon the internet for damn near everything, and they'll take it as the gospel truth.  We have over 30 million people in the US who believe Trump won the 2020 election in spite of volumes of evidence that say otherwise.  This technology along with deep fakes will be disastrous.  I predict in the future Altman will ask himself, \"What the fuk did I do?\"   An Oppenheimer moment.",
