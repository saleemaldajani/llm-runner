Whether God given,  or generated by chance,  our intellect is the only thing separating us from apes, and not by much. Our recorded history only goes back a few thousand years,  hardly a blink of a eye in relative to our tenure here. We have billionaires and millions starving. We have golf courses in deserts and many without drinking water. We have people dying while others get surgery on a whim. We have geniuses in slums and fools in boardrooms. We have saints in prisons and sociopaths in government. We have barely scratched the serface of our potential,  and yet, you want to give it all away. We have hardly yet learned what is important.  We have not even realized how equitable earth can be. We have not even tried to better ourselves, and you want to abrogate our responsibilities.  \nAll we have is our individually,  and you want to make us as ants. A few have barely achieved greatness, and you want to make us servants.  You would put us second in line. You would take away all incentive to achieve.  All gumption to grow. All reason to think. You would hand off all responsibility to a machine. Our only claim to fame you would give to a robot. Our only quality,  intelligence,  you would toss out with barely a second thought.  Because if you really did think, you would realize that no matter what innovation your machine intuits, it won't be man's achievement.  It won't be mans accomplishment.  We will be second class. We won't have choice. We won't have freedom.  We won't have self. God can never again be proud.  Nature will never again be in charge.  Man never again will be first. We loose our place in history,  in sovereignty,  and in humanity.\nYou're doing this just because you can, but not because you should.  You should speak to Fritz Haber and Robert Oppenheimer first.",

        "comment": "Re: Consciousness, the freshmen college dorm conversation, and \"what is an AGI\"\n\nI think its a meaningless question. Decartes pondered on this and philosophy in general has as well. Starfleet asks this question about data in TNG. We can't verify or define consciousness as a fact or non-fact any more than we can verify or deny the existence of god.\n\nIs the human being a \"stochastic parrot\" made of simple biological processes, is it an algorithm running in a simulation of some greater truth, or is it animated by a forever intangible spirit, or is reality itself a hallucination of my mind?\n\nIt is not a measurable metric. Asking \"is an AI conscious\" is ultimately not an important question to ask because it is not a question we can ever have an answer for. Its the question \"does it have a mind?\" and the mind itself is an abstraction we only invent because we ourselves, individually, feel as if we possess one. We might not.\n\nThe difference is that other people intrinsically are analagous to us, and AI is not. We know the origin of its mind and we determine the parameters of its subjectively experienced universe and we determine the reason for its being. We don't discover if it is conscious. We tell it if it is or not. We discover if it can accomplish tasks, and we prevent it from accomplishing tasks we don't want it to regardless of how \"intelligent\" it is.\n\nOur intelligence might be this murky and mystical right of fate or biology or a divine gift, but its intelligence is a product of human intent and human design. Is it conscious is a pointless question and the only question that matters is whether or not it is aligned to do the things we want it to and avoid the things we do not.",
