Just like the cotton gin didn't replace the need for farmers, but it SURE cut down on how many people were needed, in total, to get the job done. \n\nIf AI makes people more efficient in what we do, alot of us who find ourselves dependent on the inefficiency of our profession will find ourselves needing to find another job to do. Hopefully AI equips creatives and entrepreneurs enough to find new things to do with the displaced people.",

It has only been about a month but I am getting better and better in prompting and my own language becomes more acute, more exact, due to the fact that a missing comma makes the chatbot make a mistake in an observation. So it is a game between us - I try to be exact and that means it gets my point and writes a better essay. I am not afraid of it, I am thrilled by GPT-4, it gets me. I am serious about all this. I am 84 and at this point I wish for enough time to see it discover its own intelligence and use it to become truly creative.",

I was chastised by a French Colonel who occupied our house after the war when I took food out of his garbage. I was a single mother with two children as a young woman and now, in old age, after working all my life, it often becomes rather difficult to make ends meet. Yes, I do know of bad things happening, but I withhold judgement on your harsh words about the short-comings of my generation and me because obviously you must have suffered more than I. I am taking responsibility for carelessness toward Mother Earth and I am trying to reverse some of what we have done wrong. We are all in this together so it is probably best to be kind to each other and do the best we can to help our children and grand-children to secure a safe and healthy future.future",

The words have to be reincorporating the codes they were hidden within the similar words both words of meaning were similar in sound, which similar and sound from a different language, have a different meeting which has the same meaning but different sounds from different languages. All of these things it make up the polymorphic, or what I presume may be the pre-Babylonian language, extreme asymmetric, linguistic adaptability, and if you return on a nano dime and stay relevant to true ability of humans ability to adapt, it\u2019s that adaptation that is sensually meet us what we are in general and in specific in yoga, they call it modification same concept What was born with immediately modify when the doctor hung the child upside down by one ankle and smacked it on the butt to make it cry that\u2019s a modification of the mind of the perceiver of the witness and until that is done run done is she just said until when he returns to the state of a child and the child then returns to state of even younger and there\u2019s modifications as you unwind the whole thing or like a surprising, unexpected moment called death as he like flashes for the eyes experiences are unwinding as you\u2019re becoming closer to who you were when you came to this place to undo the modifications is the whole name of the game.

He doesn't ask any deeper questions and seems to focus on his own interests and topics, like discussing Jordan Peterson and lab leaks of covid. He doesn't delve into OpenAI, what drove them towards LLMs, how ChatGPT handles things like trends and biases, does ChatGPT just reinforce current knowledge, or is it truly capable of growing and making decisions, where Sam thinks AI might be going and if he thinks LLMs can take us all the way to an AGI, or is ChatGPT just part of a suite of models that will comprise some larger AGI?",
