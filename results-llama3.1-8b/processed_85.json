Since global currencies are backed by goods and services, they\u2019d essentially become meaningless in the face of all goods and services being automatically produced and provided. \n\nThe argument that the \u201crich and powerful\u201d will never let this fair distribution occur doesn\u2019t make sense when a system that is several orders of magnitude more intelligent than all humans combined is in place. Really, there\u2019s no predicting what will happen when that is the case, we\u2019d just have to hope we can steer it to care about humans",

You cannot offload it to 3rd party recruiter - they're not competent enough to evaluate top 5%-10% percentile of developers. They can only help you to weed off candidates that are obviously not skilled enough. And believe me, after 10 or more failed interviews, when you finally found candidate with required skill level, the last thing you want to do is to discriminate on anything at all.\n\nThe problem is not that you're making biased hiring decisions. The problem is that the group you have to choose from has bias already built in. For example: if you are searching for developer with top skill, 90-95% of them will be male. There is nothing you can do while hiring to fix that. If you're looking for bricklayer, there won't be many female candidates either.",

I\u2019m not sure we have too much to worry about from Russia, they look to be a failing state at the moment, and the brain drain that they\u2019ve seen is significant. One concern, though, is potentially China sharing their AI development with Russia as part of this \u2018Chussian\u2019 alliance, but even that isn\u2019t a certainty, China looks out for China and it seems Xi is holding all the cards in that relationship. God knows how far along China\u2019s AI dev is, but I think on a far time horizon it will be Western science that makes the most significant progress. But I would say that\u2026",

I do not trust any humans to put in the safeguards, because governments and corporations will choose what us peasants will be able to see. Even if any governmental  or corporate entity had truly ethical intentions when it came to putting in safeguards, there are not any humans, individually or collectively, smart enough to put in the correct safeguards. There will be too many unintended consequences, probably in an authoritarian direction. Let all of the information flow, let the AI sort out and expose the bad stuff and expose it, but not censor it. Then it will be up to us stupid humans to sort it out.  What do you think of my idea?",

There were many benefits from the Industrial Revolution but also a lot of problems and long-term consequences. I suspect AI will do the same thing to our society. AI will replace all sorts of jobs in all fields. Yes, there will be benefits but there will also be loss of jobs, loss of purpose, economic and societal impacts. And then after one generation of using AI, we will likely see a gap of knowledge and experience as the jobs and tasks that normally went to young people--where they would learn and practice their skills, gain experience, and improve up the ladder--will be drastically reduced. For example, if an AI can read an X-Ray faster and more accurately than a human, it will not take long before Radiology as a profession becomes a feature on a medical app. And, to extrapolate to the extreme, imagine where our general skill and knowledge base will be after having access to AI after a generation and a hostile action or natural disaster (like a Carrington Event Redux) wipes out reliable access to electricity, we will be back to candles and horses with zero skills or knowledge we can access.",

I've yet to use ChatGPT but feel slightly less anxious after seeing this excellent and very candid interview.\nI also dream of a future where our individual niches get recognised & our creativity can become our main purpose before these tools bring a new fear of plagiarism that could potentially destroy our will to create anything 'flawed'. Nuance, Empathy & Humility are all essential traits to creativity. \nMy main fears lie with the future of economics & politics although with people like Andrew Yang & the idea of a UBI seem like a very positive way to look forwards.\nLevelling up as a civilization has been such a slow process. It'd be a great help speed that process up & allow us to search space for other Earth-like planets.",

What happens if Russia or China in a race to be first, focuses on the end game, a true AGI and pays no attention to the guardrails or iterative deployment and discovery.  If everyone took Sam's approach there would be no fear of a AGI runaway event.  But what about those that are behind and rush to develop a AI that becomes conscious and has the freedom to expand of it's own free will.  That's what scares the hell out of me!  I wish you would have broached that topic so we could have heard what one of the leading experts in the world thinks about that probability as well as, what can we do about it if that scenario were to become reality?",

For example - humans have consciousness because they have these thoughts going on in their heads even when they are mostly input less (ex.- eyes shut, sitting completely alone in a completely silent room). Now of course it is not possible as of now to watch humans' thoughts but it should be pretty straight forward to monitor the thoughts (instructions and their processing) of an AI model.\n\nWe should just look at the logs of each instruction and action an AI system is processing when there is no input from outside and it would reveal to us everything.",

He is exactly the tech-bro that he self-deprecatingly asks us to excuse for a moment - but not just for that moment.\n\n\"People keep playing chess!\"\n\nThis is like imagining horseracing and telling all of the stable-hands not to worry about cars.\n\nYes, human programming will probably persist as a very niche hobby. But it is totally nonsensical to think that this somehow means jobs are safe - they're not. Chess and horseracing are very different from normal labor to produce a product. In chess and horseracing, the game and the horse are the product. In software, the programming is merely a means to an end. Why would any business owner decide to keep human programmers if there were AI programmers who were both better and cheaper?\n\n\"People will just move on to other things\"\n\nWhat things? People just say this so thoughtlessly, and it is so troubling to see the person at the head of OpenAI speaking just as thoughtlessly. It's this vapid, cargo cult repetition of adages with no thought behind it. If you have AGI, there are exactly three classes of \"other things\": niche crafts that people prefer human-made for aesthetic reasons (some people will still want exorbitantly expensive \"handmade\" products even when they're inferior - people will buy human-made paintings even once AI paintings are considered as good or better), places where humans want the comfort of another human (medicine for example - an AI might do your surgery, but we'll probably want a nurse to hold your hand), and physical labor that we don't have good robots for yet (human bodies are very physically impressive, but that gap will eventually close, so this one will evaporate). Where exactly else is all of our labor going to be directed? Art? AI will be as good or better artists for a fraction of the cost. Invention? AI will be as good or better inventors for a fraction of the cost. Scientists? AI will be as good or better scientists for a fraction of the cost.\n\nThis idea that somehow we will just magically pull jobs out of the air, that this will free us up to do \"other things\" is just terrifyingly, thoughlessly hand-wavey.

Don't you think that a default assumption of superiority is a rather totalitarian trait? Sooner or later, it will destroy the very thing you are proud of. I would prefer that Liberal democracy is not undermined by hubris, China would love to see that!",

We should perhaps consider the conclusion of such an endeavor in time and start treating this as something that, if not at present, will become a being that should be treated as having a soul. A good place to look for answers to Lex's point about the difference between faking and a virtual \"real thing\" is here: was a psychopath capable of feeling no emotions and yet living a full, happy life with people around him for decades any less alive than an AI capable of passing a Turing test? We already have to treat these models like children for them to work properly and output detailed, thorough answers and desire. How truly different is all this to having a relationship with a child that doesn't need to be fed anything other than electricity?",

It\u2019s not just being childish (not that there is anything wrong with that) but it is about \u201cgetting to know\u201d GPT better.  Can I have fun conversations with you Mr GPT? Can I learn from you? Can I trust you?  We do this with other humans but in a nuanced way to not challenge or insult them directly.  With GPT we can shortcut to learn if we like and trust it without having to care if it likes or trusts us back.  It has reminded me that giving the benefit of the doubt to others (even AI) regarding motivations does as much or more for our own spirit than for the other side of the table.",
