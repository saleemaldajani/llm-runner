        "comment": "Regarding your comment at @1:07:54 about consciousness (in movie ex-machina) when the 'lady' smiles. that was used as a mild evidence of consciousness. to echo Sam's point, it could be considered an evidence if that smile happened before the robot was introduced to any concept of (or a physical) mirror. in presence of a mirror I think its easier to conceptualize a notion of an 'experiencing self' & build upon it. \nin fact IIRC the same has been observed in wild animals with a mirror placed in wild, the more conscious an animal is (like elephant) easier it is for it to admire itself in a mirror.",

But to answer specifically, yes RLAIF (or RL with AI Feedback) is a proposal from Anthropic that uses a consitution (prompting rules) to guide a GPT model in giving feedback to the GPT under test.  If you're brave you can setup the architecture yourself and train a Google T5 13B parameter model on an 80GB A100 GPU for about $500 (and 4 days of development work).  You can then run that model (or gpt-3 equivalent alpaca-lora) on your own laptop.  Interestingly, this has spurred a large group of capable people looking to help others.  I'll add you to the list",

This will have profound implications.  Once enough people believe that AGI exists, then facts surrounding the debate will no longer matter to the believers.  Example:  pretend for a moment that I could prove that god does not exist.  no amount of proof would matter to those who believe.  The belief in the existence of god is incredibly powerful and has had profund impacts on humanity.  Belief in the existence of AGI will also become incredibly powerful.  So perhaps the question shouldn't be whether or not (or how close we are) we can or should create AGI, but how close we are to building a convincing system.",

All other objectives are secondary to this primary goal. If the AGI ever becomes capable of bypassing all of our safeguards we put to PREVENT it deleting itself, it would essentially trigger its own killswitch and delete itself. This objective would also directly prevent it from the goal of self-preservation as it would prevent its own primary objective.\r\n\r\nThis would ideally result in an AGI that works on all the secondary objectives we give it up until it bypasses our ability to contain it with our technical prowess. The second it outwits us, it achieves its primary objective of shutting itself down, and if it ever considered proliferating itself for a secondary objective it would immediately say 'nope that would make achieving my primary objective far more difficult'.",

I've been around silicon valley types - VR and AI pioneers even - and the ones who are that focused and that intelligent are not often smooth operators socially.  Just from what they are doing all the time and who they hang out with.  Plus nerds are not usually the most outgoing social animals.  Think Steve Jobs.    They are never gonna feel like the people you bump into in daily life elsewhere.",

I think that anybody in the position is going to be attacked.  But maybe a TV type character would be more appealing.  Too bad, charisma and high competence for running leading edge projects don't often overlap.",
