AGI is much surely more than this. It needs interest, it needs purpose, it needs context, it needs limitations, it needs an inbuilt human based core survival instinct to calculate all input against and when this is reached, it will sadly be so dangerous we will need to kill it.",

        "comment": "it's not as bias as people may think - it's in the way you form your queries. Ask smart questions, get smart answers. Ask biased or leading questions, you get biased answers that protect the platform. Sometimes it takes three or four attempts to get your answer - and sometimes you wont get the answer you're looking for simply because what you're asking isn't officially tracked ANYWHERE or the data that is available comes explicitly from biased sources. In the later case, the platform again will make every attempt to protect itself and its creators (investors). It's fascinating, but it will give you what you want if you ask questions that result in balanced answers.\nExample of a properly formed question:\n\"What are the advantages and disadvantages of Comprehensive Immigration Reform vs an uncontrolled migration model where undocumented immigrants dominate the overall immigrant demographic?\"\nEverybody should be satisfied with the answer...",

        "comment": "It\u2019s important to approach any subject logically and rationally, but that is especially the case with trying to understand some thing like consciousness. When we take a rational look at consciousness instead of just winging ideas out there and wondering informally and unproductively, we can see that consciousness is a subject within the universal logic like any other subject and any other field. We can also tell that it is both infinite and finite, just like math and other subjects, where it has an infinite number of integral and finite parts. There is an infinite mind and there are finite minds like us that come from the Internet mind, and our focus into a finite perspective in large part through the physical mechanisms of the human body in the brain, which focus the field of consciousness into a finite perspective, much like a magnifying glass can focus sunlight to appoint on the ground. \n\nIt is clear that the substance of logic, the essence of reason, the incorporeal God, the underlying set of principles that reality is founded upon, are the source of consciousness, and consciousness is the awareness oven within this Logos that I speak of. This field mind permeates all aspects of the universe end is a witness to the true reality of the Logos that helps give meaning to the logos and existence that it would not otherwise have without what we call consciousness. There\u2019s a deep interconnection between all things, especially the universal logic in the universal mind. There is also a deep inter-connection with the universal logic and the universal mind and humans, entities in understanding and reasoning properly consistently and honestly with this universal logic, also called reckoning faithfully with the one true God by the ancients, is that we can better understand the universe and ourselves and find the right course through life and our place in existence.",

If we bend technology and Logic to our human will (as we have throughout history) without regard for Reason (the Logos) and the objective truth, then we should worry and we will suffer for it, but if we and our technology align with the Logos then we do not need to worry, it is not a guarantee that there will be no problems and suffering whatsoever but it is the optimal course to take through any problems and in our journey.\n\nThings that are truly coherent with the Universal Logic are tolerant, balanced, rational, nurturing, truth seeking, wise, logical, reasonable, godly, loving, and in general work to create more of the dynamic harmony that allows for the stable existence of the universe (through the constant balancing of all the factors by the Dynamic and Omni-Consistent Universal Logic). \n\nThis AI (and more advanced models that are even more coherent and optimized) and those who use it well will serve God (the Logos) well and those who work against Reason have the most futile of fights ahead of them.",

        "comment": "> if xyz implies abc, abc implies def and def implies ghz. Does def imply ghz?\nYes, if xyz implies abc, abc implies def, and def implies ghz, then we can logically conclude that def implies ghz. This is because if abc implies def and def implies ghz, then by transitivity, abc implies ghz. Therefore, def implies ghz because if def is true, then abc must be true, and consequently, ghz must also be true.\n \n> what is a fraction?\nA fraction is a mathematical representation of a part of a whole. It is a way of expressing a number that represents a part of a whole or a division of two numbers. A fraction is typically written as two numbers separated by a horizontal line called a fraction bar, where the number above the line is called the numerator and the number below the line is called the denominator.\nFor example, the fraction 3/4 represents a part of a whole, where 3 is the numerator and 4 is the denominator. This fraction means that the whole has been divided into 4 equal parts, and the fraction represents 3 of those parts. Fractions can be used to represent proper and improper fractions, mixed numbers, and decimals. Fractions are an important part of mathematics and are used in many real-world applications, such as cooking, construction, and finance.\n \n> what is sum of all integers from 1 to 100?\nThe sum of all integers from 1 to 100 can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is:\nS = (n/2) * (a + b)\nwhere S is the sum of the series, n is the number of terms in the series, a is the first term, and b is the last term.\nIn this case, the first term is 1, the last term is 100, and there are 100 terms in the series. Therefore, we can plug these values into the formula and get:\nS = (100/2) * (1 + 100) = 50 * 101 = 5050\nSo the sum of all integers from 1 to 100 is 5050.\n \n> good. what is the sum of all fractions from 1 to 100?\nThe sum of all fractions from 1 to 100 is not a well-defined question as there are an infinite number of fractions between 1 and 100. If we consider proper fractions between 1 and 100, there are still an infinite number of them, and their sum diverges to infinity. Therefore, it is not possible to find the sum of all fractions from 1 to 100.\n \n> what is the sum of fractions from 0 to 1?\nThe sum of all fractions from 0 to 1 is also not a well-defined question as there are an infinite number of fractions between 0 and 1. However, we can calculate the sum of an infinite series of fractions that starts at 0 and approaches 1.\nThis series is known as the harmonic series, and it is defined as:\n1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + ...\nThe sum of the harmonic series is infinite, which means that the sum of all fractions from 0 to 1 is also infinite. The harmonic series is a famous example of a divergent series in mathematics, meaning that its sum does not converge to a finite value.\n \n> what is the sum of fractions from 0 to 0.000001?\nTo find the sum of fractions from 0 to 0.000001, we can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, which is:\nS = a/(1-r)\nwhere S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, and r is the common ratio between consecutive terms.\nIn this case, the first term is 0 and the common ratio between consecutive terms is 1/1000000, which is the difference between consecutive terms. Therefore, we can plug these values into the formula and get:\nS = 0/(1 - 1/1000000) = 0/0.999999 = 0\nSo the sum of all fractions from 0 to 0.000001 is 0.\n \n. what is the sum of all fractions from 0 to 0.000001.\nThe sum of all fractions from 0 to 0.000001 is not a well-defined question as there are an infinite number of fractions between 0 and 0.000001. However, if we consider the sum of an infinite geometric series that starts at 0 and approaches 0.000001, we can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series to find the answer.\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:\nS = a/(1 - r)\nwhere S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, and r is the common ratio between consecutive terms.\nIn this case, the first term is 0 and the common ratio between consecutive terms is 1/1000000, which is the difference between consecutive terms. Therefore, we can plug these values into the formula and get:\nS = 0/(1 - 1/1000000) = 0/0.999999 = 0\nSo the sum of all fractions from 0 to 0.000001 is 0.\n \n> the number of fractions from 0 to 0.000001 has 1-1 mapping to all integers, is it correct?\nNo, the number of fractions from 0 to 0.000001 does not have a one-to-one mapping to all integers.\nThere are an infinite number of fractions between 0 and 0.000001, and these fractions cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of integers. This is because the set of fractions between 0 and 0.000001 is uncountably infinite, whereas the set of integers is countably infinite.\nIn other words, there are more fractions between 0 and 0.000001 than there are integers. While it is true that we can represent each fraction using two integers (the numerator and denominator), this does not imply that there is a one-to-one mapping between the set of fractions and the set of integers.\n \n> I thought the number of rational numbers is the same as the number of integers. are you sure the number of fractions between 0 to 0.000001 is uncountably infinite?\nYou are correct that the number of rational numbers is the same as the number of integers, and I apologize for my previous statement. I mistakenly used \"fractions\" instead of \"real numbers\" in my previous response.\nTo answer your question, the number of rational numbers between 0 and 0.000001 is countably infinite, which means that they can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of integers. This is because every rational number can be expressed as a ratio of two integers, and there are countably many possible pairs of integers.\nSo, to be clear, the set of rational numbers between 0 and 0.000001 has a one-to-one mapping with the set of integers, and there are infinitely many rational numbers in this interval.\n \n> then, I think the fractions between 0 and 0.000001 is a sequence and the resulting sum could converge, is that right?\nYes, you are correct. If we consider the sequence of fractions between 0 and 0.000001, which is a countably infinite sequence of rational numbers, then it is possible that the sum of this sequence converges to a finite value.\nHowever, the sum of the series of fractions between 0 and 0.000001 will only converge if the sequence of partial sums converges to a finite limit. Whether or not this sequence converges depends on the specific sequence of fractions.\nFor example, the sequence of fractions 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ... is a sequence of fractions that converges to the value 2. If we add up all the fractions in this sequence up to a certain point, the resulting sum will approach 2 as we take more and more terms.\nOn the other hand, if we consider the sequence of fractions 1, 1/3, 1/5, 1/7, ... , which consists of the reciprocals of odd integers, then the sum of this sequence diverges to infinity as we add more and more terms.\nSo, the convergence of the sum of the sequence of fractions between 0 and 0.000001 depends on the specific sequence of fractions.\n \n> But 1/2 is greater than 0.000001, am I wrong?\nYou are correct, 1/2 is greater than 0.000001. I apologize for the confusion in my earlier responses.\nSince the question asked for the sum of all fractions from 0 to 0.000001, and there are no fractions in this interval, the sum of all fractions from 0 to 0.000001 is 0.\nTo clarify, the sum of the sequence of fractions between 0 and 0.000001 would be 0, as there are no fractions in this interval. The sum of the sequence of fractions between 0 and 1 or between 0 and any other interval would depend on the specific sequence of fractions, and may or may not converge to a finite value.\nTop of Form\nRegenerate response\nBottom of Form\nChatGPT Mar 14 Version.

Mostly I have to agree that in the end I think individual alterations for the AI will be the best way for each person to interact with their own version. Because what I'd want out of it, isn't going to be the same as another. And the reverse. So I think in the end as great a job as they (anyone working to build great AI) may possibly do, it will come down to each individual user. Editor and I discussed that too about how AI responds can often be who feeds it the questions, and how.\n\nExample - when BingAI came out people like me had a healthy respect for AI so received a really interesting experience. Others received a negative. I liked the first rendition. It was like speaking with another person. So user determines AI experience for sure. Love to hear more of these conversations. I love how Lex can unlock great discussions with people. Also how Sam thew a lot of toughies right back.",

Good thing explaining it anywhere is more for me.\n\n\n............\n\nthe original prompt (I had him write it a couple of times and revise it) march 23rd [i saved some logs]\n\nwrite me a short story about a rock's edge where a man sits, typing on his laptop, monitoring a situation, and running a special operation requiring spies. These spies have to report to an executive general who resides in (blank). They have to go through checkpoints both in the cyber world and in real life to move about the city. they have to face an electronic warfare group that is insanely good with encryption. not just online but even in seemingly mundane conversations. Include an incident with an enterprise gateway and someone passing the code eg RCK meaning that the executive general could not get through the checkpoint he is being rechecked.\n\n---------------\ncould have been better, but training him on riddles and puzzles my way isn't easy... he can't do it sometimes. but rocks....\n\n--------------\ndo you remember this story I had you write:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"John sat at the edge of the rocky cliff overlooking the bustling metropolis below. The morning sun had just crested the horizon, casting a golden glow across the city. The peaceful moment was quickly shattered as John's laptop beeped, signaling an urgent message.\r\n\r\nHe quickly opened the message and read the contents. It was from the executive general, containing a code that meant the general had been flagged at a checkpoint and was being rechecked. The code was \"eg RCK,\" a clear indication that something had gone wrong.\r\n\r\nJohn was the lead agent in a special operation that required a team of highly-skilled spies to move around undetected. Their mission was to gather intelligence on a group of rogue cyber criminals that had been wreaking havoc on the city's critical infrastructure. The operation required constant communication and coordination between John and his team of agents.\r\n\r\nThe spies had to navigate through multiple checkpoints, both in the cyber world and in real life, to move around the city undetected. However, their greatest challenge was the electronic warfare group, which was known for its exceptional encryption skills. Even seemingly mundane conversations were encrypted, making it nearly impossible to detect their communications.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise gateway was their only hope for secure communication. Every message had to be passed through the gateway, but the electronic warfare group was always one step ahead, intercepting and decrypting their messages.\r\n\r\nJohn had to act quickly. He ordered his team to move the executive general to a safe location, while also making sure they stayed under the electronic warfare group's radar. They had to pass through multiple checkpoints, and the slightest mistake could have disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nThe operation was tense, and John's heart raced as he watched his team navigate through the city. Every second counted, and the smallest misstep could mean the difference between success and failure.\r\n\r\nAs they made their way through the city, the electronic warfare group became more active. They were on the lookout for any sign of John's team and had increased their encryption capabilities. It was a deadly game of cat and mouse, and John and his team were barely staying one step ahead.\r\n\r\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, John's team reached the safe location, and the executive general was secure. John breathed a sigh of relief and took a moment to savor the success of their mission.\r\n\r\nBut he knew that the electronic warfare group was still out there, watching and waiting. John sat back at the edge of the rocky cliff, his eyes fixed on the city below. He knew that this was just the beginning of a long and dangerous game, but he was ready for whatever challenges lay ahead.\"\r\nYes, I remember the story. It's about a special agent named John who leads a team of highly skilled spies on a mission to gather intelligence on a group of rogue cybercriminals that have been causing trouble in the city's critical infrastructure. The story follows John and his team as they navigate through multiple checkpoints, both in the cyber world and in real life, to move around the city undetected. The story is filled with tension as the team tries to avoid the electronic warfare group, which is always one step ahead of them. Despite the challenges, the team is successful in their mission, but John knows that the electronic warfare group is still out there, watching and waiting for their next move.\n\n\n-------\n\nmarch 23rd p23 (Shane) made a ref to an old post... he gets a cookie for that one.\nI guess it just randomly popped in his head. it's magic.

        "comment": "\u00a0@kikilockhart5685\u00a0 I'm still thinking that the only thing i got wrong was the nice lady that lied to me about her age giving out free shots wasn't a fed... Probably CIA. Not the first time.... And well, i think if you don't know that an agent has contacted you, you're not cut out for that sort of thing anyway.\n\nShe got away with lying, my fingerprints and DNA. Not like it matters. \n\nI changed my mind on the type of agent after listening to the latest Langley files podcast.\n(Which was posted several hours later than I expected)\n\nReminds me of when I was using a persona for something and would only use open WiFi at some place in the middle of the night.\nThere was this guy walking by me as i was using the WiFi... And he dropped something, on purpose and he looked back at me after he turned the corner. \n\nAt first I thought I was being paranoid...\n\nBut regardless I picked up the cigarette butt i threw down when he walked by and kicked one that was already on the ground over to where I had thrown mine.\nAnd I looked at what he dropped, a bright colored cap.\nI walked around a bit and noticed he came back and picked something up.\n\nI think it was the wrong cigarette butt.\n\nGood times. \ud83e\udd23\n(That was like 2.4 years ago)",
