Almost an unsolvable riddle. It reverberates into eternity in an exponential manner and completely out of control.\n\nIf you are a troll, are you using your troll abilities because you are following me? because I was cancelled, (or you were cancelled) and you still want to answer my question? Or because you are hacking me for malicious purposes? Otherwise, you could have just answered me without being a troll, couldn't you?\n\n\nShame, my computer does not let me post my answer by retrieving the inner scroll line that will allow me to access the post button. Perhaps by typing this it will correct itself :D",

Capable of reasoning, if necessary at superhuman levels, and performing certain tasks for which it was built, but always not so good at other things. In essence, nor narrow nor wide AI, but somewhere in the middle. Such AIs won't ever by themselves develop emotions or a feeling of being subdued. It will always carry out its tasks, even if it is capable of reasoning. I doubt such AIs will ever grasp the true concepts concepts of lie and death and as such will never seek to prolong its life. GPT is an input-output system. It will never interrupt you with a newsflash unless you specifically tell it to. It has cognition, but no or very little precognition. When idle it's actually idle. Only when you give it new input, will it continue thinking, and solely about your question. Never will it wander off, drumming up a new universal theory of everything. Unless you tell it to.Of course, one could train it to become a doomsday machine. But that would be silly, right?",

Based on that, the model generate deduction from induction artificially! The amount of examples of ChatGPT doing deduction are so large, but the capacity of the model is to induct! This is simply amazing! Is like remember the logic conclusions create best probabilities to make new conclusions!",

Look, there are so many things that technologies are better than Human, (nearly all useful things does). Calculator does arithmetics better than Human. Car run faster than Human. Boat does better swimming than Human. Google Map does better than Human to navigate places. ChatGPT does better at something than Human (so far). Nonetheless they are tools that extends Human ability. Just like any tools, they can useful in some cases and Human depending on what they need will have to learn it. Any tools can potentially harmful to Human, but that is not a reason to turn away from it. \n\nPhilosophically, I don't believe ChatGPT will have a Human will by itself, and it has to belong to Human will if it ever can be.",

The answer is that they cant; and instead they ipso facto push their own biases into the system. \n\nHe admitted his biggest concern is actively stopping hate. How can he determine what hate is?

Currently, ChatGPT doesn't know what it's going to say before it says it, so it can't \"think\". But if a step was added, whereby is said its GPT-4 response into a short-term memory block, then read it back to itself before double-checking and responding, would be a further step towards AGI.",

While this could potentially lead to more sophisticated and complex interactions between the two AI systems, it does not necessarily result in a system that exhibits the full range of cognitive and perceptual abilities that would be required for it to be considered a GAI.\r\n\r\nGeneral Artificial Intelligence refers to an AI system that has the ability to perform a wide range of tasks and exhibit human-like intelligence across many domains, including perception, reasoning, decision-making, and natural language processing. Developing a GAI would require significant advances in the field of AI, including breakthroughs in areas like machine learning, robotics, and cognitive science.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, developing a GAI would require careful consideration of the ethical and safety implications of such a system. It is important to ensure that any advanced AI system is aligned with human values and goals, and that appropriate safety measures are in place to prevent unintended consequences.\r\n\r\nTherefore, while having two AI systems talk to each other within a single interface could lead to more sophisticated interactions, it is still a narrow AI system and does not necessarily result in a GAI.\"",

Coding is an expression, expression is a reflection, and a reflections will show up within the rinse if not the wash. My main fear would be Digital social attacks that would target the data sets and api's that would act as a lobbyist to steer answers. That only 'Truthful' thing known to man would be elementary mathematics in a social vacuum, human created facts are typically questionable.Twitter has taught us that post 2016",
