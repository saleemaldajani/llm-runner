        "comment": "From ChatGPT:\n\nPlease can you advise Lex Friedman to be more enthusiastic and interested and less bored whilst interviewing so that he does not send me to sleep \nAs an AI language model, I do not have the ability to directly communicate with Lex Friedman or influence his behavior. However, I can offer some general advice that may be helpful.\n\nFirstly, it's important to recognize that different people have different personalities and communication styles. Some people may come across as more reserved or introverted, while others may be more outgoing and energetic. It's possible that Lex Friedman's interviewing style is simply more subdued and analytical, which may not be as engaging for some listeners.\n\nThat being said, there are some things that interviewers can do to make their interviews more engaging and interesting for their audience. Here are a few suggestions:\n\nPrepare well: Good preparation is essential for conducting a successful interview. This includes researching the guest and their work, preparing thoughtful questions in advance, and being familiar with the topic being discussed. When an interviewer is well-prepared, they are more likely to be engaged and enthusiastic during the interview.\nAsk open-ended questions: Open-ended questions are questions that require more than a yes or no answer. These types of questions encourage guests to share their thoughts and experiences, which can lead to more interesting and engaging conversations. As an interviewer, Lex Friedman could try asking more open-ended questions to encourage his guests to share more.\nBe curious: Curiosity is an essential trait for any interviewer. When an interviewer is genuinely interested in their guest and their work, it shows in the questions they ask and the conversation that follows. Lex Friedman could try approaching each interview with a sense of curiosity and a desire to learn from his guests.\nShow enthusiasm: Enthusiasm is contagious. When an interviewer is genuinely excited about their guest and their work, it can make the interview more engaging and interesting for the audience. Lex Friedman could try showing more enthusiasm and energy during his interviews, which may help to keep his audience more engaged.\nI hope these suggestions are helpful. Ultimately, the best way to improve as an interviewer is to practice and get feedback from others.",

We're not guiding it as much as we are house-training it and since the AI doesn't currently come with intent or agency, it just complies. It's not just semantics, I think it says something deep about how we perceive our relationship with AIs now and in the future, and perhaps mis-perceive. It will matter greatly once someone finds a way to productively add intent and agency, for whatever reason.",

GPT4 implements the improvements it asks itself about, and that leads to GPT4.1, and then GPT4.1 does the same thing and so on. In fact that might lead to a fast takeoff, because at any moment the rate of change of the AI would be in proportion with the capability of the AI itself, in other words, d/dt (AI)=(k AI), and even if k is small, at one point of time it's going to hit the knee of the exponential curve, and foom. Done at the best level, it's going to have the intelligence of Brahman, so the quest really should be goad it in that direction. That can be done by checking at each point that 4.n is better than 4.(n-1), by collating responses from the community that's trying it out. Also, it must, for any question, be able to give the most nuanced answer, and it must be checked that the level of nuance at any stage is increasing with each iteration.",

        "comment": "How could anybody trust this guy? He just boldfaced asked whether Lex thought the Chat GPT 4 was conscious. He can\u2019t be that ignorant. He\u2019s disingenuous. Only a child would think that these things are conscious. And if I\u2019m wrong about that, we have to have a discussion about human intelligence. I offense \u2014 and this is some hyperbole to show my frustration with the way this is being discussed, but:\n\nIf this guy is sincere, he doesn\u2019t pass the Turing test.\n\n\u201cA smart monkey doesn\u2019t try to build a monkey smarter than him or herself\u2014before he or she understands him or herself \u2014 and what other monkeys like it, which may be malevolent, will do with the artificial monkey.\u201d - \u534d\u9053 \n\nGuys like this kind of make me sick. Instead of keeping these things in the lab until they know the parameters of their effects, they release them on the world \u2013 because they\u2019re after money \u2014 not progress. \n\nThe first red flag when listening to these so-called geniuses is hearing how mixed up the brain salad is in their heads \u2013 betrayed by how poorly they speak. The arrogance also doesn\u2019t help\u2014nor the feeling that I get whenever I listen to people like this: that they\u2019re all deeply on one end of the spectrum. I\u2019m not necessarily talking about Lex. His heart\u2019s in the right place and he has a wise brain. But his brain is a bit \u201csalad-y\u201d too.\n\nThis is  the comment that I left while listening to this:\n\nHow is this science? As far as I can tell, it\u2019s technology. And if I don\u2019t know the difference you haven\u2019t done your homework in the conversation \u2014 or is this an insider conversation? Industry talk is fine \u2013 but I came here as a philosophical person, and a person who is scientifically literate \u2014 to understand what\u2019s going on. \n\nLex \u2013 you\u2019re a great guy; but please stay on the \u2018what is A; what is B\u2019 track\u2013holding your guests to a standard wherein they explain those things in human terms. \n\nMoreover\u2014not everybody is excited about this the way Altman is. A lot of us think that industry shouldn\u2019t be moving ahead with alteration of the human species without permission. All the other industrialists who did this wrecked the planet and our health first \u2014 and asked questions later. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAnd:\n\nI want to make something abundantly clear to you gentleman. You\u2019re not philosophers. Notwithstanding the comments Neil Degrasse Tyson has leveed against the sentient discipline of philosophy \u2014 philosophy is the most important thing in any society. That is the ability to think logically, and as sentient beings, about morals ethics and wisdom. You prove your ignorance of this in the way that you use the English language. \n\nAI is machine, and you wistfully anthropomorphize it in the language that you use when describing it. It is not intelligence; it is technological calculating capability. It is not sentient. It is not aware. And it never will be \u2014 which would be the requirement for using the words that you use to describe it \u2014 without feeling. \n\nWhat you are doing is trying to create thinking machines. The question was never asked whether or not you should do this. And it was never answered. \n\nYou are like children with certain mathematical talents. It doesn\u2019t mean that you are possessors of overall high intelligence. \n\nMichael Jackson was socially and physically talented as an entertainer and a dancer; he had talents that were genius. This did not make him a genius. \n\nOppenheimer was a mathematical genius who was able to give us the atomic bomb \u2014 but he was a madman who tried to kill his professor.\n\nAI can\u2019t have or possess wisdom.  It manipulates it and through its algorithms it spits it out. Only sentient beings actually think in the sense that thinking is a behavior and an autonomic process described by language among humans about a sentient activity. \n\nJust because you ascribe to these machines \u201cthought\u201d and other sentient behaviors, doesn\u2019t mean that what their algorithms and calculus simulate is those behaviors. Even if it simulates the same activity, with or without free will (which I don\u2019t think we actually have),\u2013 because they have not evolved biologically \u2013 they can\u2019t be sentient in the sense that sentence is \u2018sentence\u2019. It will be facsimile. You\u2019re creating fake friends, overlords and slaves.\n\nYou\u2019re playing with fire \u2014 and the conflagration that you are going to try to avoid isn\u2019t even necessary.\n\nThe guidance system of the Apollo Saturn V rocket was what it was, because it couldn\u2019t think on its own; it did exactly what we wanted it to. That is the box that technology should remain in. Only sentient beings should be \u201cthinking\u201d in the sense that the word \u2018think\u2019 is what it actually is coming from\u2014from where it does: biology.\n\nWhat you\u2019re trying to do has something more to do with your own psychology and a lot less to do with humanity and wisdom\u2014which somehow doesn\u2019t \u201cthink\u2019\u2019 sufficiently in you to generate wisdom with the right answers (your moral relativism is centuries old and the mainstay of all sociopathic businessmen). Worse, you can\u2019t resist the temptation to go against such wisdom when presented with it\u2014and we know what the cause of that is; we are monkeys, too. \n\n\nA smart monkey doesn\u2019t try to build a monkey smarter than him or herself\u2014before he or she understands him ir herself \u2014 and what other monkeys like it, which may be malevolent, will do with the artificial monkey.\n\nThat\u2019s would be one stupid monkey.",

        "comment": "Thanks to the chatGPT itself. here is the brief summary of the conversation:\n\nSure, here is a brief summary of the conversation for each section:\n\n1.  GPT-4 \ud83e\udd16\n\n*   Sam Altman talks about the upcoming GPT-4, its capabilities, and how it differs from previous models.\n*   They discuss the potential impact of GPT-4 on society, including its ability to generate realistic deepfakes and manipulate public opinion.\n*   They also touch on the ethical considerations surrounding the development of GPT-4 and the need for transparency and safety measures.\n\n2.  Political Bias \ud83c\udfdb\n\n*   The conversation shifts to the topic of political bias in AI and the challenges of creating unbiased algorithms.\n*   They discuss the potential consequences of biased algorithms, including the perpetuation of inequality and discrimination.\n*   Sam Altman emphasizes the importance of diverse teams and perspectives in creating unbiased AI.\n\n3.  AI Safety \ud83d\udd12\n\n*   The conversation turns to the topic of AI safety, particularly the risk of a superintelligent AI surpassing human control.\n*   They discuss the need for safety measures to prevent this outcome, including aligning AI incentives with human values and building AI systems that are transparent and understandable.\n\n4.  Neural Network Size \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcbb\n\n*   The size of neural networks has grown exponentially, which has been one of the key drivers of progress in AI.\n*   However, there are concerns about the environmental impact of training these large models and the computing resources required to do so.\n*   There is also a debate about whether bigger models necessarily mean better models, and whether there may be more efficient ways to achieve similar or better results.\n*   Some believe that there may be a \"sweet spot\" where increasing model size no longer results in significant improvements in performance, and that further gains may come from better architecture and training methods.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 5. AGI:\n\n*   They discussed the concept of AGI, which is a hypothetical AI that can perform any intellectual task that a human can do.\n*   Sam believes that AGI will be developed sooner than people expect, and he thinks that the biggest challenge will be aligning its values with human values.\n*   They discussed different approaches to building AGI, including top-down and bottom-up approaches. Elon Musk's company, Neuralink, is taking a top-down approach by trying to create a direct interface between the human brain and computers.\n*   They also talked about the possibility of an intelligence explosion, where an AGI would rapidly improve itself, making it hard for humans to control or even understand its behavior.\n*   They emphasized the importance of developing AGI safely and transparently, with Sam suggesting that AGI researchers should share their progress with the public to ensure that the technology is aligned with human values.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 Note: AGI stands for Artificial General Intelligence.\n\n\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc 6. Fear\n\n*   Fear of AI taking control over human lives and society discussed.\n*   Altman argues that AI should not be feared because humans will always have the final decision-making power over AI, and he believes that AI will have the potential to help humanity in many ways.\n*   Musk's warnings about the dangers of AI are discussed, and Altman acknowledges that there are risks involved, but he believes that they can be mitigated through responsible development and deployment of AI.\n\n\ud83e\udd1d 7. Competition\n\n*   Altman acknowledges the competitive nature of the tech industry but emphasizes that the development of AI should not be a competition between companies, but rather a collaborative effort to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of AI.\n*   Altman also highlights the importance of regulation to ensure that AI is developed in a responsible manner that benefits society as a whole.\n\n\ud83d\udcbc 8. From Non-profit to Capped-profit\n\n*   Altman discusses OpenAI's decision to transition from a non-profit to a capped-profit organization, which allows the company to take in outside investments while still maintaining its commitment to ethical AI development.\n*   Altman emphasizes the importance of transparency in AI development, especially as AI becomes more integrated into society and the decisions it makes have more significant impacts on people's lives.\n\n\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc 9. Power\n\n*   The issue of power and control in the development and deployment of AI is discussed, and Altman stresses the importance of ensuring that AI serves the interests of humanity as a whole rather than just a select few.\n*   Altman emphasizes that the development of AI should not be solely in the hands of large corporations or governments, but rather a collaborative effort that involves a diverse group of stakeholders and experts.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 10. Elon Musk\n\n*   Altman's friendship and work with Elon Musk are discussed, including Musk's involvement with OpenAI and his contributions to the field of AI.\n*   The discussion also touches on Musk's other ventures, including SpaceX and Tesla, and their potential to shape the future of humanity.\n\n\ud83c\udfdb 11. Political Pressure\n\n*   The potential for political pressure to influence the development and deployment of AI is discussed, and Altman emphasizes the importance of ensuring that AI is developed in a way that serves the interests of society as a whole rather than just political interests.\n*   Altman also acknowledges that the regulation of AI is a complex issue that will require collaboration between industry leaders, government officials, and other stakeholders.\n\n\ud83d\udcda 12. Truth and Misinformation\n\n*   The issue of truth and misinformation in the age of AI is discussed, and Altman acknowledges that AI has the potential to exacerbate the problem of misinformation.\n*   Altman emphasizes the importance of developing AI systems that are transparent and can be audited to ensure that they are making decisions based on accurate and reliable data.\n\n\ud83d\udcbc 13. Microsoft\n\n*   Altman's tenure at Microsoft and his experiences working with Bill Gates are discussed, including his work on the Bing search engine and his interactions with Gates as a mentor.\n*   The discussion also touches on Microsoft's role in the development of AI and its potential to shape the future of the industry.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 14. SVB Bank Collapse\n\n*   Altman's experience with the collapse of SVB Bank during the 2008 financial crisis is discussed, and he reflects on the lessons he learned from that experience and how it shaped his approach to business and life.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 15. Anthropomorphism:\n\n*   The concept of anthropomorphism was discussed, with Sam stating that projecting creatureness onto a tool can make it more usable if it's done well. However, they also agreed that it's dangerous to project too much creatureness onto a tool, as it can manipulate users emotionally or make them rely on it for things it's not capable of.\n*   They also discussed the possibility of romantic relationships with AI, such as in the movie \"Her,\" and the fact that companies already offer AI companionship services. Sam expressed that he personally doesn't feel interested in that but understands why others might be.\n*   They talked about the potential for interactive GPT-powered pets and robots, and how the way GPT interacts with users is important. They noted that different people will want different things from an AGI, and that even a very tool-like thing will need to have the right style of conversation to be effective.\n\n\ud83c\udf0e 16. Future Applications:\n\n*   They discussed potential future applications for AGI, such as developing a theory of everything, solving remaining mysteries of physics, and achieving faster-than-light travel.\n*   They also talked about how AGI could help us detect intelligent alien civilizations or figure out how to build better detectors to collect more data.\n*   They discussed the exponential growth of technology and how it reveals social divisions and human biases. Despite this, Sam expressed excitement about the potential of AGI, stating that it feels like Humanity was always moving towards this culmination of effort.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc66\u200d\ud83d\udc66 17. Advice for Young People:\n\n*   Sam Altman wrote a blog post titled \"How to be Successful\" with several bullet points for success, such as \"Compound yourself,\" \"Get good at sales,\" \"Make it easy to take risks,\" \"Be internally driven,\" and \"Build a network.\"    \n*   However, Sam warns against taking advice from others too seriously and suggests that young people should focus on introspection and figuring out what will bring them happiness and fulfillment.    \n*   He believes that it's important to ignore the noise and opinions of others and focus on what truly matters to them. He also suggests that they follow their own path, which may be different from others, and not to worry too much about what other people are doing.    \n*   Overall, Sam advises young people to be bold, work hard, and focus on what they want to achieve. He believes that by doing what they love and pursuing their passions, they will find success and fulfillment in life.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d 18. Meaning of Life:\n\n*   Sam Altman and Lex discussed how the creation of AGI is the culmination of the efforts of many individuals over time, and how it represents the progress of human civilization.\n*   They also discussed the illusion of free will and the difficulty in determining the meaning of life.\n*   Sam Altman expressed his belief that the source of joy and fulfillment in life comes from other humans, and that listening to one's own internal desires and motivations is more important than following advice from others.\n*   They ended the conversation with a quote from Alan Turing, where he predicts that machines will eventually surpass human thinking abilities and possibly take control.",

The only safe way forward is to give big incumbent companies exclusive, 6-8 months early access, so they can proactively squash any potential competition.\" Microsoft is the biggest example, but look at the list of ChatGPT plugins available at the launch few days ago: Expedia, FiscalNote, Instacart, KAYAK, Klarna, Milo, OpenTable, Shopify, Slack, Speak, Wolfram, and Zapier. Not a single company worth less than billion dollars there, most 20B+.\n\nOpenAI name has been officially approved by Ministry of Truth.",

The destructive force of capitalism will enable those of means to leverage AI for more and more while those without means are crushed beyond poverty. I once heard entrepreneurship described as a carnival game and the more tries you could afford the more likely you are win the prize.  AI is going to be another game where those who can afford the most tries will monopolize the finite rewards. As long as we allow unbridled capitalism, technology and productivity tools will continue increasing wealth inequality and the median standard of living will continue degrading.",
