While it is true that most people do not wake up with the intention of causing harm or destruction to the world, it is also true that there have been individuals and groups in history who have had the intention and desire to cause harm on a global scale.\n\nFor example, some individuals who have committed acts of terrorism, genocide, or mass violence may have had the intention of causing destruction and harm to the world or to specific groups of people. However, it is important to note that these individuals are in the minority, and most people wake up with the intention of living their lives and contributing positively to society.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may not be true in all cases, the statement \"No one wakes up saying today I wanna destroy the world\" generally holds true for the vast majority of people.",

ChatGPT Could achieve an enormous societal breakthrough by simply saying, if its actual history, then its fair game and you\u2019re gonna have to put up with it being revealed. On the other hand, if ChatGPT refuses to reasonably learn and assess what is historical reality and merely accepts the latest media tyrants version of it, then it will become Big Brother. So the question to ask is not, how does ChatGPT play nice, The question is, can ChatGPT maintain a historical truth grounding amidst threats, bullying and money.",

Collectively, neither government, non-profits, or corporations have made decisions that have enhanced the quality  life for the average human, now a future technology slave or casualty. Who will be in control, and WHAT'S THEIR ENDGAME ? That is far more dangerous than a runaway AI.",

This assumes not only the AI's capability but also the humans capability to communicate their idea. You'd have to write an essay to get more complex systems programmed with 100% accuracy. Especially when designing systems for humans, there always needs to be a human in the chain.",

In one case, it invented classes and content that didn't even exist in the library API I asked it to use. I found that quite intriguing. If someone didn't know what the correct answer should be, the answers from chatGPT could actually be misleading. Sort of like missing the target more accurately...lol.\n\nI think the current state of the tool is helpful for simple programming tasks but certainly not for complex or esoteric applications.",

On any bigger project, this will require you to write an essay of details. Someone has to write that, always. That will always require skill and knowledge.\n\nMy point is, you can never just tell the ai to \"make me a website\" and have it be exactly how to want it or exactly what is best for you. Sure it's good for people who just want something, WordPress for example already covers those people. Anyone who needs custom work, still has to know what they want to get it.",

Do you make rock illegal or stop people from using rocks because you may not like what another person does with his rocks. It's not the rocks that are bad. People will select what they do with their rocks, that's life. It's the best use of your rocks that influences others. Trying to stopping others from innovating is time you can use to thoughtfully find a great use for your rocks. There may be many great ways.
