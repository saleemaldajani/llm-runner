Centralzied planning was one of the things thay actually worked, especially during the post war time. Soviets did succeed with the rebuilding of the cities, sending rockets the space, creating powerful and advanced war machine (at that time), building factories, and so on. It all happened at a huge cost of low living standards of ordinary people, who were poor all the time. I'm not even talking about democratic and other freedoms that didn't exist in USSR.",

If we lived forever, how boring would life eventually become, how angry would be at the stupidity and evil we see that stands beside us immortal that foster their remaining purpose of existance in control and power over everyone else.

        "comment": "Great discussion. On consciousness I agree with Sam, it is not about emotion. I would posit the following necessary properties: 1. sense of self i.e. possessing the concept of 'I'; 2. sense of self as an object over time; 3. sense of the world as other than self; 4. sense of relation between self and world; 5. sense of interaction between self and world; and perhaps 6. Sense of power I possess to make changes in the world. These properties are potentially identifiable and trackable in any model. \nOn the alignment problem - one idea could be a morality training stream. This could embed a values set into the heart of any AGI. It seems that unlearning is not a property of such system and harnessing this might be one step in creating and, over time, reinforcing alignment.",

It's the same as multiple humans debating each other. To get a higher quality of thought we need not only more \"neurons\" but also more layers of thought, more iteration.",

There are species nowhere near as intelligent as humans and yet they're very much conscious. \n\nI know this won't go well with the materialist crowd, but consciousness is  something of a God's spark in creation. When someone dies, their body and brain are still there, yet they no longer work, the consciousness is gone. \n\nAI is a machine and always will be a machine, it's not going to become conscious, there's only one way in which we can create other conscious beings.",
