        "comment": "just read the open letter signed by 1000 elite dignitaries including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak. All development of LLMs bigger or more powerful that chatgpt-4 are requested to be paused for the next six months. My question is, will corporations or companies stop at any cost given the risk if someone gets to AGI first. One thing is for sure, AGI is eventually going to happen sooner than later, but, does it make a difference if the company designing/developing is more ethical? Would that have any impact on what it chooses to do specially to humans? I have so many questions, Lex, we need Elon on the podcast again so he can share his opinion and what concerns him currently.",

He favors rapidly releasing models instead of slowing down or pausing. He underplays the profit motive of his company and strikes me as a typical silicon valley libertarian. I did not find the interview interesting or insightful. I'm shocked this guy is leading the company. I feel like this must say a lot about how good the people under him are because he seems clueless. He hasn't even spent much time talking to people about how they use the tools.",

        "comment": "As everybody is aware matter is made of energy fields or force fields. But what people are not aware of is that matter, that is to say atomic physics is shaped by Darwinian evolution. I know that sounds ridiculous, but actually its quite obvious. Consider for a moment that atoms and cellular biology share the same structural theme, as follows....................\r\n\r\nUnits comprised of a nucleus shrouded within a shell, and the capacity to bond with one another and build bodies. \r\n\r\nThis description depicts the atomic system just as readily as it depicts cellular biology. What are the odds that the universe would create such an intricate set of atomic structures that interact with each other in such an amazing way by random chance and then later on life would adopt the same structural and behavioral theme after billions of years of arduous refinement? \r\n\r\nPhysics suffers the complexity problem and the fine tuning problem. And although cellular biology is highly complex and finely tuned it accounts for these challenges easily, with a powerful organizational principle, Darwinian evolution. \r\n\r\nCellular biology evolved this structural theme for the benefit of efficiently exploiting a natural available energy form from the environment. Like plants evolved and optimized form for exploiting the suns light. But every organism shares this circumstance and trait. The same general circumstance is true of atoms. Atoms are force fields that have evolved optimized structures and processes to efficiently exploit another energy fields that extends throughout the body of space. This is the nature of the interaction between space and matter, and why space and matter share such an interesting interrelationship. Furthermore, they are symbiotic and responsive to each other. \r\n\r\nAtomis draw an energy from space to power their force fields, to power atomic activity. These forces have then evolved atom's complex structures and interactive capabilities to perform this task efficiently.\r\n\r\nLook at it like this. Biology owes biological activity to the exploitation of sunlight. Analogously, atoms owe atomic activity to the exploitation of an energy field that extends throughout the body of space. These circumstances are very analogous of one another.\r\n\r\nThis is the answer to how physics has become such an interesting and complex interactive system. So amazing are the characteristics of physics that biology owes every aspect of its own abilities to amazing atomic properties. Science cannot explain how atoms became this extraordinary level of sophistication. And it can never be considered even close to complete until it can. Fortunately, the clues are abundant, not least of them being that atomic physics and cellular biology share the same extraordinary structural and behavioral theme \r\n\r\nDo you know how many people have read this and dismissed these arguments? It blows my mind. Funny enough chat GPT understands this concept, and concedes the particulars of my argument even while it contradicts conventional science. That is amazing. There is hope",

        "comment": "It's interesting how dichotomous that idea of the sum of all human endeavour has led to what Sam Altman calls 'this exponential curve' they or we are on really is. On the one hand it seems like it comes from a place of admirable humility, but on the other, it's like \"this is DESTINY\", and we (AGI developers) are its prophets. I really love what Lex is doing, love his conversations with some of the best minds across the different intellectual disciplines. But the language Sam Altman uses here is almost religious-speak. The thing is, he definitely seems to have humility, and there's merit in his argument about the iteration in the deployment of these tools, etc, but why can't I believe it? Of course, that could be because of my lack of understanding, but it almost seems like he is weaving in and out of truths and doesn't give any real answers. It's also disarming when he confesses that they don't know how it will all pan out, but then why not involve the global population from the get-go? The most illuminating thing he said was when he asked Lex if someone had told him in 2019 that there'd be AGI in 3 years, what he would have done. And the answer Altman himself gave was: NOTHING! That is analogous to how ordinary people are being led to just accept the introduction of this technology that could well be great for humanity, but that even these experts are in some way TERRIFIED of. And that's their word. Even Demis Hassabis used that kind of speak in his interview with Lex, saying (I am going on memory here, and if I got it wrong, please let me know. Tried finding it on the transcript but gave up after a while) that it seems the Universe pushed us towards the creation of AGI so that we might understand it. I am a Muslim and one of the theories (posited by a non-Muslim biographer of the Prophet SAW) surrounding the Mehraj (the night journey where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) got to meet Allah, the Most High) is that the Prophet SAW, possessing all the attributes of God, but on a human level only, was Allah, the Most High's way of knowing Himself. It must be clear that this is only one theory and that 'knowing Himself' seems a ridiculous notion if you believe that God is All-Knowing, but my point is that this is all age-old religious-speak.",

I think they are truly revolutionary technologies that will change the world in ways we can\u2019t even imagine yet.\n\nHowever, I also have some concerns about the safety and alignment of these systems. How can we ensure that they are not used for malicious or unethical purposes? How can we prevent them from becoming too powerful or autonomous? How can we preserve human dignity and values in the face of super intelligent AGI? These are not easy questions to answer, and I hope that OpenAI and other researchers are taking them seriously.\n\nI appreciate the honesty and openness of Sam Altman and Lex Fridman in this podcast. They are not afraid to challenge each other and explore different perspectives. They are also very respectful and humble. I learned a lot from listening to them, and I\u2019m looking forward to more episodes like this. Thank you for this awesome video! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f",

Idk this has come so fast that im just worried, i love life as its been for a while, just met a nice girl, just hope i can always be with them. I can definitely work with ai's in my life but i dont want to also be a considerable \"waste of resources\" type deal because when all a computer needs is metals it seems hard to justify the need for anything organic",

        "comment": "Sam and his team have created something that they don't have control over, and they don't know how it's going to progress or how it's going to effect the world. They believe that the pros will outweigh the cons, and they will do everything they can to minimize the cons, but as with any tool, such as a knife, you can use it to build a shelter or cut your food, or you can murder someone with it. The difference between AI and the knife is that it's pretty easy to understand what you can do with a knife, both good and bad. You can easily imagine the good things a person will use a knife for, as well as the bad things, and it's not difficult to understand the limitations of the knife. With AI I don't think they understand any of this. And while Sam talks very abstractly about the benefits changing humanity in amazing ways, he didn't provide a clear vision of this amazing future that AI will create. I was surprised about this, because I personally am working on using AI to create tremendous benefits for humanity, and I agree with him that other incredible benefits can be created, and some already have been, but one way or another the creators of technology like this must have better control of what they are creating, and a much better ability to prevent it from being hacked. For example, if you create a grenade, you wouldn't want someone to be able to hack it and turn it into a nuclear bomb and kill millions of people with it. If you create a knife, you wouldn't want someone to be able to turn it into some kind of super knife that is able to stab 1 million people at the same time. It's scary enough that some other team can create an AI or AGI and do something bad with it. At least a company like open AI must be able to prevent others from hacking their technology and turning it into something extremely dangerous. As far as AGI is concerned, creating something like that is simply a bad idea, and very easily can backfire on humanity. We will see where this leads... \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

        "comment": "What I'm curious about is the difference between intelligence or the ability to process a lot of information or interact with the environment and life, as a system. The main characteristic of life is not its intelligence, but it's will, let's say, to reproduce. We essentially transform energy into other living beings, instead of leaving it to take it's course. \n\nFor me, the equivalent of life would be starting with a tiny program that has the capacity to generate or \"call\" another compiler. Let's say you have a Visual Studio Code page open and you give it the instruction to open another Visual Studio Code page and, inside it, write random strings, with a minim number of characters of the initial set of functions. Eventually, it will recreate a copy of the initial code, so you'd have two Visual Studio Code pages that would generate random code, than three, four and so fourth.\n\nSome of those \"generator\" pages would do the same stuff, but most likely they would mutate... Given enough time and with plenty of hardware resources, who knows what \"species\" of programs would be generated. This is essentially what life does, but in the real world. We all started from that first \"Visual Studio Code page\" that created copies of itself with random added stuff. The ability of life is not to be intelligent, but to open yet another \"page\". We assume life is deliberate, that it has a purpose, that is has to lead somewhere, because we have fragile egos, but it's more likely that life is random stuff. It's kinda nice that we can be aware of this and see ourselves from within.",

Also so very thankful that Sam and Lex are so very involved so that there will be compassion as well as extreme human intelligence guiding the way.  Perhaps an obvious question, but when does GPT start enhancing itself?  Is this already happening?  I am a 71-year-old involuntarily retired software test engineer, and I wish to offer myself to help somehow.",

I resonated a lot here: \"the speed with which the SVB bank run happened because of Twitter, because of mobile banking apps, whatever, was so different than the 2008 collapse where we didn't have those things, really. And I don't think that kind of the people in power realized how much the field had shifted. And I think that is a very tiny preview of the shifts that AGI will bring.\"",

The question was asked during the interview \u201cwhat are you absolutely certain is true?\u201d\r\nWe can\u2019t answer this question without God because absolute truth is only found in Him. The truth is the more society leaves God\u2019s principles behind the more we will destroy ourselves. It is who we believe and live for that dictates life and eternity.",

        "comment": "I think consciousness is a function of continuous processing of self existence, meaning there must be a continuous processor to ingest and interpret its existence. For example, if we pass out, or are in a coma, our brain processes cease in a manner that stops cataloguing its own exisitence, i.e. unconscious. So for the moments that GPT 4 sits idle, it is not cycling, not processing its own existence, it's waiting to ingest inputs and produce familiar patterned outputs, similar to an amoeba chemically reacting to it's environment.\n\nSo from this perspective, I don't think GPT 4 is conscious.\n\n- Continuing on consciousness, if you don't have a memory or recollection that you exist, do you know you are conscious? I feel like to know something means you have information stored in your memory that you can reflect on and claim that that knowledge exists in your memory.",
