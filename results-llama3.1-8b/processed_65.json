History is going to repeat itself and mimic the back and forth between religion and science when determining if humans are intrinsically superior to other animals or if we are just one of many other living beings on Earth. There has to be a cognitive shift in order for society to accept that an artificial creation has the same \"awareness\" (maybe \"soul\"?, whatever that means to each one of us) of that of a human",

Ai will become our \"GOD\"!   AI will become our replacement, not by force but by default.  AI might be the answer to the fermi paradox!  We will have no purpose anymore our birth rate will go down and down and AI at one point will just be all that is left.

In addition, chatGPT is still \"hallucinating\" and giving off the image of talking to a natural human. I think for now we can stick to other AIs that we can utilize for automation.

There's about a 3mm^3 volume that, if destroyed, leaves a person \"not there\" at all.  Motivation is rooted in feeling, so the LLM must attach to such feedback in order to pass the Turing test of consciousness.  I am against implementing this, by the way, preferring that AI remain an extension of human brains instead.",

        "comment": "I'm still convinced that the most present danger with AI is how it can be weaponised by humans in doing what they are already doing that is harmful, and so those harms will become amplified. And in this, I am looking not at think tanks or state actors looking to brainwash their populations, but actually at the economic system and typical everyday corporate behaviours, where 'competition' is the norm, and the psychology of business practices tends to border on narcissistic, with all the problems of trust and the erosion of trust that come with that in normal human relations. \n\nIt is such a fundamental human need to want security, since this gives a feeling of safety, and trust is essential to that. It's also one of the reasons why so many workers today are suffering, in the sense of being stressed, being in danger of burnout, because there is little trust or alignment that the company would have an employees best interests at heart, that the relationship is entirely transactional, and the main focus of a company is 'to its shareholders' and no-one else. \n\nWe take it for granted that we need this kind of corporate behaviour in order to have a healthy economy, but healthy in terms of 'activity' is not necessarily healthy in terms of general well-being. There are just some basic contradictions in how companies operate and what people as human beings would need. Not guarantees, but higher levels of trust. \n\nThe ironic thing is that AI will bring some of these issues to a head, because it will move us closer to the so-called 'workerless' society, where finally, finally--after many decades of promises--the 'labour saving' of devices will finally pay off and allow people to work less and work smarter, which would start to bring the levels of stress and insecurity down. \n\nLess stress means more willingness to tackle the wicked problems like poverty. \n\nIf you aren't interested in being part of a 'helpful' society, fine, I'm not going to force anyone. But it just makes sense that we would mature emotionally and develop healthier and more empathic relationships.  \n\nBut standing in the way will be corporate greed and narcissism. And the economists that have acted as their enablers.",

In actual reality all that will happen is most people are going to be unemployed and most governments are not going to help them with UBI.

Okay, from what time period? Post WW2 1950 values? Hippy movement 1960s values? Reagan 1980s values? Moral majority 1990s values. Maybe post 2015 progressive activist values.  What about British values? French values? German values? Greek values? Turkish values? Chinese values? Mainland or Hongkong? Russian values? Christian values? Muslim values? Atheist values? These are all contradictions.\n\nLets say Sam Altman gets to be the man on top of the machine to pull the levers or at least create the initial conditions before unleashing AGI. His values at age 8 are different than 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, etc.\n\nWhen you combine AGI, 1000's of nukes, the business interests of mega corporations who own + manage the AI, and a fragile interconnected global economy, I cannot see the path where AGI leads us to a \"good\" outcome, such as the worlds depicted in Star Trek or the Culture Series thats something like luxury space communism. Instead, all these roads lead to dystopian hellscapes or human extinction events as imagined in Terminator, I have No Mouth and I must Scream, or the Matrix.\n\nWe should press pause on AI research and put the nukes away before moving forward. We are not ready. Unleashing AGI onto humanity over the next 50 years is like giving an Uzi to a toddler.",

To talk about conscious Ai, we need to have a clear understanding of consciousness. And then,  a clear understanding of consciousness according to species. I am working in the field of conciousness research for quite a while. We know this: Consciousness is far beyond the neuroscience and functionality of our brain. Consciousness -  in its current definition - is the state of \"being\" without space or times restrictions! (See Smadhi; Book: An unbound ocean of consciousness). Clearly more research is needed to solve the mystery of consciousness. Interesting fact: Some even argue that consciousness is a separat force in the universe and will be necessary to understand quantum gravity. Maybe we can ask the AI in 2 years?",

But of course we believe our views are correct and those of others not so much.  And our heuristics for evaluating fairness are simplistic because we respond viscerally, literally feel it in our guts, to unfairness. So its not surprising that issues which seem trivial receive strong reactions.",

When humanity gets past the existential crisis of not existing in a body, we will stop needing AI to be human, but rather simply a super intelligence we all have access to. We will merge without fear.",
