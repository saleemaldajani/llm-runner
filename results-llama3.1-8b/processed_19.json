People aren\u2019t confused about NEEDING A PAYCHECK TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES! Regardless of whether someone likes their job or not, they very likely NEED the paycheck to put food on the table, have a roof over their heads, buy diapers, etc. Sam seems to be the one who\u2019s not only confused about that - he comes off as being completely oblivious to the fact that massive job loss caused by AGI would most likely lead to an increase in the number of people who are homeless & don\u2019t have medical insurance (due to the loss of their jobs) which tends to trickle down to increases in mental health issues, drug use, violent crime, etc., etc., etc. \nBut - sure, Sam \u2026 a smaller group of people would possibly get paid more \u2014 because companies won\u2019t keep the money to increase profits, right?? \nPeople who haven\u2019t been living paycheck-to-paycheck for a long time have no clue what it\u2019s like to live with the constant stress of making ends meet & they don\u2019t have the slightest f*cking clue how those people feel about their jobs. The truth is, most of those people don\u2019t have time to feel anything about their jobs in many instances because they just NEED A PAYCHECK TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES! \nSam - the next time you want to talk about AGI taking customer service jobs from people trying to make ends meet, or taking jobs from anyone for that matter, maybe you could show just a little bit of humility & humanity since your work will make a direct contribution to the issues mentioned earlier \u2026 an increase in mental health issues being at the top of that list. \nCongratulations, Sam. Job well done! \n**I recognize that \u201cprogress\u201d has a cost. Some of the issues I mentioned might be unavoidable. That doesn\u2019t mean Sam shouldn\u2019t acknowledge it. In fact, he SHOULD be working to find ways to minimize the negative impacts of AGI on people.\nBased on the way Sam spoke about it, I\u2019m now in full support of stopping development of AI/AGI until the people involved show they\u2019re equally focused on preventing or reducing the damage caused by their so-called \u201csuccess.\u201d",

        "comment": "33:45 That is the primary factor of AI behavior, and the most important factor in life.  Nothing we think or do is undetermined by values.  We all know this, but do we act like we know it?\n35:01 Never forget the browser wars.\n1:40:48 Similarly, the precursor to economic and political changes is social movement (mass change in collective values), and I am excited that the science of alignment may lead to a deep intellectual understanding of what values are in logical terms and why they're the primary factor in behavior.  This might help us align ourselves or at least help point us in the right direction.\n\nWe take much for granted because our powerful brain does so much work making sense of things for us, that we evidently don't realize the worth of all we get to perceive as humans.  Thoughts, feelings, emotions, experiences which come naturally, with no degree of effort required.  Of course it gets complicated and difficult when we have internal struggle, it becomes work to achieve good sense- because our minds have run away with us, doing so much of the processing in the background that we forget or fail to notice alltogether what truly matters to us.  Questioning why things don't feel right when we ought to know why we do what we do if we were fully conscious of doing it.  Lack of reflection, relation and realization, are forfeiting the true worth of being alive.  Whether the machinations we allow to think for us are the ones we create or the ones already inside our heads.",

        "comment": "I once listened to a series of Elon Musk interviews where he was asked about A.I., and one thing I remember him saying was thar the danger of A.I. is the arrogance of the scientists behind it. People like this haven\u2019t truly calculated and considered the dangers of their own creation, and their response to dissenters like me is \u201cbrotrustme\u201d. That\u2019s what horrifies me about these \u201csmart guys\u201d. It\u2019s reminiscent to what happened in the movie Spider-Man 2 with Doctor Otto Octavius. He gets asked by Peter multiple times, \u201cHow do you know things won\u2019t go south??\u201d His response was basically \u201cbrotrustme\u201d. We know the outcome. His quest for power nearly led to half of New York getting killed. The same danger exists here. Too many egomaniacs posing themselves as measured, smart thinkers. Meanwhile, they refuse to put limits to their work, while bringing up the possible dangers, as if that is the same as limiting their own power as inventors. They are guided by their own god complex and quest to be in history books. They don\u2019t give a single shit about helping people. I have a hard time believing this guy cares about the people he passes in the street, let alone people at large.\n\nAnyway, rant over. Sorry.",

Indeed, IT hides too well a significant use of energy and it seems to me that you do not take enough into account. Unlike the guest, I don't see the cost of energy decreasing over time. We reached the peak of conventional oil production in 2006-8 or so. The US has been exploiting mainly shale oil since then. These are much more expensive to get out of the ground and are still absolutely necessary for the rest of the economy (for the transportation of any goods).  So I don't think we need to go any further in the search for the development of artificial intelligence.",

It is hard to estimate it, but >50% (likely more) of the work was done and made public by researchers at Google and many other companies. Yet in this podcast we have a story of guys in the wild pursuing AGI when nobody believed them, but now they finally do. :))) ML 101 - transfer learning on a transformer at scale is not AGI and is not even a new idea. But again, from the product, sales & marketing perspective it is amazing what OpenAI has built.",
