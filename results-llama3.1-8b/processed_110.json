        "comment": "It probably couldn\u2019t pass as an undergraduate beyond first year courses in my experience doing undergraduate maths. It confused me when I asked it for examples relating to lyapunov stability, asymptotic stability of dynamical systems. It gave an example of a damped pendulum and said it would not come to rest as time went to infinity. I corrected it, it then stipulated the example was fine because damping was weak so the pendulum would not come to rest at time went to infinity. I corrected it and it accepted that any damping would cause a pendulum to come to rest as time went to infinity. Tbh: i don\u2019t even know if im correct or if it\u2019s correct so it wasn\u2019t helpful (that guy was right, a lot of undergraduates can\u2019t do math and I am one of them \ud83d\ude05). \n\nI expect that, once trained on proper maths data (or maybe with these plug ins but I think they\u2019re a patch solution and we could do much better and I bet we will) an AI would be leaps and bounds ahead of undergraduates, at the very least in our sad, sad, intellectually flailing UK (I also took an education module lol). Something to note though: I knew it was wrong but im not skilled enough to explain how it was wrong properly. When showing to a friend (one with influence in my circles) he believed ChatGPT was \u201ccorrect in some sense\u201d even when I said NO this is wrong (this was at GPT-3.5) and proceeded to explain how chatgpt was kind of right and I wasn\u2019t. I got GPT-4 to explain it for me when it came out. When I showed him GPT-4 slam-dunking his dumb ass and confirming I was right he just said \u201coh I was wrong\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve thought a lot about whether these language models are reasoning and currently I wouldn\u2019t say so given these kinds of mistakes at least not in the way I mean when I ask the question (it\u2019s a bit philosophical for me lol I don\u2019t have the skills to tackle \u201cwhat is reasoning?\u201d). The worrying part is human interaction with it. The worrying part is that my friend believes something the confidently espouses falsehoods and would do so unchecked without the right human to correct it. Maths homework is unimportant but watch out politics and misinformation lol. Also can u imagine getting ur face stuck on a porn through deepfakes. That\u2019s mad yo",
