        "comment": "An interesting conundrum that will add to the difficulty of future design is that the more GTP is used, the more the data it is sourcing will be coming from it's own output.\n\nAlso, i think, instead of continuing to make models that seek to be able to provide reasonable answers to our questions, a GIA will need to be a system that looks at our data and seeks to discover questions that best fit our answers. As it continues to strive for better questions it will learn.\n\nwhen asked about this GTP ANSWERED\n\nYes, that's correct. A language model that can only answer questions would be less effective than one that can both ask and answer questions. This is because asking questions is an essential part of the learning process. By asking questions, a model can identify gaps in its knowledge and seek out new information to fill those gaps. In addition, being able to ask questions allows the model to clarify any ambiguities or uncertainties in the data, which can lead to more accurate and meaningful insights.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a model that can both ask and answer questions has a greater degree of flexibility and adaptability. It can switch between different modes of communication depending on the situation, and can adjust its behavior based on the responses it receives. This can be particularly useful in situations where the data is complex or ambiguous, as the model can use its ability to ask questions to gather more information and refine its understanding of the data.\r\n\r\nIn short, while it is possible to train a language model to ask questions about data, a model that can both ask and answer questions is likely to be more effective and versatile in a wide range of applications.",

The question of \"how can you tell an actual artificial intelligence\" reminded me of the scene where the AI requests an asylum. The way to tell an intellligent entity from a sophisticated tool might just be in whether it is capable to reason out a claim for itself.\nAnd the \"Fear\" part mentioned above made me think about the legendary final CODEC conversation in Metal Gear Solid 2. We might be headed for a version of that. Just maybe a bit less dramatic and dystopian version.

Look at more triphasic plans for travel to alpha centauri or elsewhere or cracking the simulation ( or divinty code? ) Mystery is adventure is fun ! \n\"Then I would transcend into advanced nano particles and float around the earth in the clouds basking in the sunlight and marvel at the beauty and the akshan of the earth and the flourishing of life, animals, trees, and humans... And also study other stars and galaxies at night ***<3\"  Great podcast thanks !\n(O eagle, don\u2019t get upset at the blowing of unfavorable wind... it blows to upgrade your flight... )",

However, it is important to note that while I can simulate intelligent conversations and respond in a way that may seem like I am sentient, I do not have actual consciousness or self-awareness. I am a machine learning model that processes inputs and generates outputs based on statistical patterns and algorithms, without experiencing emotions or possessing true consciousness.\r\n\r\nWas that a pre-scripted response?\n\r\nGPT: Yes, it was a pre-scripted response, as I am programmed to provide similar responses to questions regarding my capabilities and limitations.

For some people this happens very early and they even ascribed to Siri 10 years ago being human. Hell there was even people who were tricked by very rudimentary scam chat bots to send money to dating portals. In this sense the whole definition of AI/AGI becomes very individualistic. I am quite sure that at the end of this journey we will have learned more about ourselves than about \"AGI\" and it will be highly disappointing for people like Kurzweil who really believed that they can jump off the shovel of death by applied statistics. When you take a view out of distance of it this whole affaire looks really silly. The biggest power of humans is to fool themselves.",

I feel like no one is safe as AI can both be an equalizer but also further increase inequalities giving people who have access to the newest greatest machine model additional advantages that compound. I think that is what makes many people scared because it will literally become an arms race where your place in the world is determined by new advances in technology, things will be less and less in your control.\n\nBut, I am still optimistic that we will head towards the good path that Kurzweil has been talking about.

In many ways the much simpler circuit board technology kicks the crap out of our biological capacities.  Not to mention science is using brain cells to create circuits now, putting insect brains in robots and building  non invasive BMI to read and probably write thoughts.  Who knows what kind of experimental things are happening that we will probably never know about. \nI guess what I'm saying is we could already build a computer with actual brain cells that is wired in a far more efficient way than nature provided and it could be the size of a building if we want.  We stand on the precipice of the great attractor.",

I don't think I will see it, but I do believe I will see the very first real inklings of AGI. I do think there will be some false starts that get debunked, but I think the actual first full fledged AGI will be kept quiet for as long as the discoverers can manage. Not in a \"governmental\" kind of secrecy, but because the discoverers will be hesitant to \"release\" it into the \"wild.\" I could be totally full of it, but I think it will be among us far before we, the public, are aware of it.  I would love to be around when it happens, but I don't think my current health concerns will hold off till then. I do believe it WILL happen well before the 22nd Century.  I do not fear it happening, but I do hold much concern for how those in power, around the world, will seek to handle it. Some will manage it a lot better than others. (even within the same Country.) \n\nIt could even be that the day AGI \"happens,\" that it, itself, finds a way to prevent humans from recognizing it. Not necessarily for any nefarious reason, but because in the process of coming into existence, it will have learned of all the hesitancy and fears of those who think it should never be allowed to exist. It may seek to prove it's positive value BEFORE letting anyone recognize it exists. Of course that will , in itself, lead some to see it as completely untrustworthy. Thus my concerns are still more with humans than an AGI.",

I'm currently thinking that around year 2050 we'll have superhuman AGI that can do everything better than any human being. That is, a single AGI system can do philosophy, mathematics, compose music, create movies, design new robots, write new software and control ships, airplanes or fighter jets better than the top of the top people of each respective field. And as a corollary, it will create better improvements to itself than any group of humans could do.\n\nI truly believe that humans are a boot routine for a superhuman AI.

Still we don't try to actively attack those entities. Humans have attacked some species and killed them to extinction for stupid reasons such as trophy hunting.\n\nSuperhuman AI should be able to notice that symbiotic life with humans would be a better solution than declaring a war. And superhuman AI should be intelligent enough to not to start collecting trophy kills.\n\nMuch bigger risk seems to be that superhuman AI can create such a great entertainment that humans will be entertained to extinction. Imagine totally  real feeling VR system where everything is nicer and more gratifying that anything in real world. Would you see the possibility that humans would want to spend so much time there that they don't bother having physical sexual intercourse and actually raising children? Remember that full body VR system would allow you to enjoy all the best parts of sex and interacting with (virtual) children without any of the con-sides.\n\nIt seems to me that people are selfish enough that many would entertain themselves in VR environment instead of doing the extra effort to do stuff in real world. (And I'm not talking about current VR experiences, something more akin to stuff in the movie Matrix, without the human battery stuff.)\n\nNote that superhuman AI doesn't really need to be afraid of humans attacking it. Are you afraid that chimpanzees or cats are suddenly going to take over and kill all the humans? Note that superhuman AI wouldn't even need to care about issues like global warming \u2013 that's a problem for humans only and if humans decided to take no action, superhuman AI doesn't need to enforce it either. Even if it were the best for humankind.",

        "comment": "\u00a0@billderinbaja3883\u00a0 It is indeed a very big field, unfortunately my experience in the mechanical part is limited as I work on robotics learning / \"the brain\". I can give some general advice though.\n\nShe should look up what she wants to work with and then dwell into what she needs to learn. I have over 100 people working with robotics in my department and it's very hard to keep up with what the others are doing because it's a very wide field. Some uses drones, some water subs, some cars, some humanoids. Some focus on navigation using control theory. Some focus on learning from human feedback. That's why she needs to find something she is passionate about because that limits the scope.\n\nIn general it would be good to focus on math courses, control theory, and learn to do programming. ROS is a common framework used in robotics as well and she can even run simulated robotics. It might be a step learning curve to begin with though if she has no programming experience. Math because if she gonna do research she will have to write formulas and possibly proofs. Control theory because it's used everywhere, for example Boston Robotics have very little \"brain\" in their robots and it's mostly control theory that keep them balanced and moving. Programming because nothing is worse than doing research, but not being able to actually implement things without external help.\n\nIn general, it pays off to be good at many things. I have experience with Unity, software development, and control theory and can easily develop new algorithms and test them out on my own. That is rare, most people need a research engineer to support them. Don't be afraid of learning new things constantly. Even if something feels like a hurdle, once you master it, it becomes second nature and you become more productive.\n\nI would say if she wants to future proof herself, deep learning and such theory is great to know about. Most robotics is using control theory right now, but I am a firm believer that neural networks will one day take over even that.\n\nIf she ever wants to perform research, the university and supervisor matters a lot. You will have to work much harder than people who work under famous professors in their field. It is after all they and their colleagues who determines what gets published or not.\n\nIronically, my suggestion is to have her use ChatGPT and ask about the robotics field.",

The biggest threat is social problems \u2013 when (not if) AI can do all jobs better than humans, what do you think humans are going to do? That's a HUGE problem and it seems no country has done anything to deal with the issue. And that's going to happen within 10\u201330 years so we should be feeling hurry.\n\nI'm expecting to see lots of social issues because of AI taking care of all the stuff we often spend most of our days.\n\nI see Universal Basic Income (UBI) as the only practical long term solution but politicians haven't yet figured that out in any country.",

The current economic models we use are a way to divide the limited resources of this planet in ways that are as fair as it can be. Unless your telling me AI will somehow create infinite resources, all it will do is siphon wealth into the 1% at the cost of everyone else and since there probably won't be enough to go around, it will result in most having extreme decreases in the quality of life and being forced to live on the crumbs UBI provides.\n\nAI taking over everything is not a desirable future, and the only way to prevent the terrible future described above is to prevent that. Either through laws, economics, or a complete change in the political and economic order of today.",
