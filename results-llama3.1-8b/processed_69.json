What happens if Russia or China in a race to be first, focuses on the end game, a true AGI and pays no attention to the guardrails or iterative deployment and discovery.  If everyone took Sam's approach there would be no fear of a AGI runaway event.  But what about those that are behind and rush to develop a AI that becomes conscious and has the freedom to expand of it's own free will.  That's what scares the hell out of me!  I wish you would have broached that topic so we could have heard what one of the leading experts in the world thinks about that probability as well as, what can we do about it if that scenario were to become reality?",

The interviewer is too close to the topic in this instance and allows Altman to obfuscate, deflect and skirt discussing the negative effects of AI. Its terrifying that Altman doesn't hesitate to say Open AI will make a version of GPT that conforms to each country's free speech laws. He claims to recoil at the thought of Communism but will acquiesce to it's demands. It indicates a lack of a moral compass despite his protestations to the contrary. Even more terrifying is that he thinks there should be a version of GPT that is biased in the direction of the user. An algorithm that caters to the user's preconceived ideas is what has lead to the nearly complete corruption of news media. Altman is missing an emotional connection to other people that would allow him to perceive the human toll AI inflicts.This guy is more dead inside than Zuckerberg and the technology he controls is 1,000 times more powerful. I do not feel better about Open AI after this interview.",
