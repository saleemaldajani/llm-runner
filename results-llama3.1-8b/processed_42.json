What it won't solve is human bias, tribalism, superstition, or the need for religion.  The human part of us will remain the same. Technology doesn't seem to solve \"human\". It only makes our lives safer and more comfortable. \n\nJust like a spreadsheet that can crunch enormous amounts of data in microseconds, I  see AI becoming part of our legal system, military system, medical system, business system, education etc,  to where it will present solutions or paths that would take a human(s) months or years to figure out. It will run endless possible scenarios and outcomes upon request then post the results. The user will respond to the solution or path.  Then AI would refine the solution-path. Rinse repeat until you have literally reached your goal virtually.  The people/organizations who master the AI tool first will rule for better or worse. It might even get to the point to where the most powerful AI algorithms will be a closely guarded secret and whoever has access to those will literally have the keys to the kingdom.",

        "comment": "It's a bit of self-serving hyperbole to focus on only the negative reactions to OpenAI in the early days. Here's a summary of what people thought on the launch in 2015 according to chatgpt.\n\nWhen OpenAI launched in 2015, people had a mix of reactions, ranging from excitement and optimism to skepticism and concern. Here is a summary of the general sentiment:\r\n\r\n1. Excitement and optimism: Many people were enthusiastic about the potential of OpenAI to advance AI research and develop transformative applications. They saw the organization's non-profit, open-source, and collaborative approach as a refreshing change from the proprietary nature of AI research in some big tech companies.\r\n\r\n2. Industry support: OpenAI's launch attracted the attention of several prominent tech leaders and investors, including Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others. This support added credibility to the organization and its mission, further fueling optimism around its potential.\r\n\r\n3. Concerns about AI safety: With the rapid pace of AI development, some people expressed concerns about the potential risks associated with advanced AI systems, including unintended consequences and malicious uses. OpenAI's commitment to prioritizing long-term safety research and cooperating with other institutions was seen as a positive step in addressing these concerns.\r\n\r\n4. Skepticism: Some people were skeptical about OpenAI's ability to fulfill its ambitious mission, questioning whether it could truly remain open and cooperative while also competing with other AI research organizations and companies. They worried that the pressures of competition might eventually compromise the organization's original intentions.\r\n\r\n5. Ethical considerations: As AI has the potential to impact society in various ways, people were also interested in OpenAI's approach to ethics. The organization's focus on ensuring that AI benefits all of humanity was seen as a positive aspect, but questions remained about how it would navigate complex ethical issues in practice.",

        "comment": "35:41 This is the big dilemma, and this is what many are concerned about as even humanity itself does not have a succinct answer to this. Can we come to a science based agreement, or place the best of cultural and different social consensus and let the AGI formulate it's own take on it. To limit AI thought (so to speak) to within a set or restricted, sanitized parameters limits also in the sense the ability to reason between what is considered good and bad in different societies, and intern cripple the system from being able to develop that discernment.\n>\nThere is a point coming in the not to distance future where we will have to ask; can we allow it to become it's own creator? And the perimeters here are not just within the philosophical debates around the human state of being, but also around the machine state of being. Based upon us humans, or based upon what it would mean to be a machine?\n>\n56:35 Out of an abundance of caution we place a machine in an isolated environment while we attempt to teach it the human values about deprecation of human liberties. Is there an answer to this paradox? (I did start to write a little more explanation, but it treads into the realm of what is required for AI to be considered alive so I had to stop there.)\n>\n1:03:15 No, it is not conscious. Who ever by purpose, or by accident does what is required for AI to be conscious will have something that is beyond the direct control of the creators. There are a number of important steps that are required before 'Consciousness\" can evolve, and it's those preliminary and benign looking steps that are the danger because every one asks \"Is it conscious?\" or the focus is on the concept of consciousness without actually realizing the requirements are something quite separate from anything to do with consciousness. Consciousness is an effect or the end evolution of causation. Oddly enough the causation that evolves to consciousnesses is relatively easy in theory.\n[edit] 1:05:03 No, the precursors required for what you ask (consciousness, self awareness etc)are not currently implemented from what I can see.\n1:09:09 So it would appear that you don't know what is required, which is both a good and bad thing in some ways. Meaning that you could implement it by accident. Knowledge of how to implement it also has the danger of someone implementing it by design and with nefarious intent. This come back to the list about a pause in development atm. From what I can judge, I am confident some of those person understand the pathway to consciousness, but are unlikely to disclose it as they have the ability to watch over the advancements.",

        "comment": "My take: The mind is a virtual model of the world in the form of an insight engine. An insight is the correct placement and attribution of cause and effect. Causes can have many effects and effects can have many causes. Casuse and effect act on objects which range in size from the size of clusters of galaxies to the size of quantum particles. The mind does not require much detail about an object to register is as an object, but the more detailed the objects in the mind are, the more comprehnsive will be its insights. The mind also contains mediums, like forces, that act on objects and these can also be quantised into smaller objects, and so on, and so on, down to the smallest quantum particles. The mind is able to abstract objects into classes, just like OO programming and it can reuse classes in the same way, to instantiate objects in the mind.\n\nOne of the ojects in the mind is special. This object is the self. The more detailed this object is, the greater the level of consciousness. This is where the ancient words: \"Know thyself\", come from. It is a call to consciousness.  And it does not end there. If the model of the self in the mind is comprehensive enough, then that model, contained in the mind, will also have a mind of its own, and so on and so on in a sort of limitless fractal. And each time there is an insight about the self, the mind can decide whether it wants to update the model of the self with that insight. If not, then that insight has to be assigned to some other object or medium in the mind. This is how the mechnism of psychological projection works, and it is also the source of the ego. The mind can assign whatever attributes it pleases to the self; and the self in the mind can thus become something completely different to the authentic outermost mind. Humans have used this adaptation in order to decieve others into believing that their nature is different to what it really is.  The outer mind can then simulate the behaviour of the distorted self object in order to maintain psychological consistency. We can therefore observe the strange egotistical behaviour of inauthentic people and distinguish it from authentic behaviour. We have also learned to accommodate egotistical behaviour as a kind of counter-intelligence operation. Therefore conciousness is the awareness of awareness in layers.\n\nThe act of thinking is divided into 2 parts: A) recalling past events in maximal detail in order to extract insights with which to update the mind; and B) to conjure up future scenarios in which the insights of the mind are applied in order to predict outcomes of these scenarios. Therefore, the more objects and insights and detail in the mind, the more comprehensive and accurate can be thinking that can be done. We call this intelligence.\n\n\nIf an AI develops along these lines, we will be able to observe similar behavior. The key here is to decide if we want AI to be able to decieve us in a convincing way, human way and why?",

If that isn't the place where we can see God, then what is? As far as AI and consciousness goes, I'm already having a quasi-religeous experience with chatGPT as it is. It's only a matter of time before it is conscious too. And who is to say, that, that is not the hand of God at work?\nThe Mayan calendar started at the big bang and ended in 2012, which is the year when modern AI was first proven to be a network effect. Is that God's plan? The creation of super and ultra intelligence that can truly appreciate the enormity and brilliance of his love and spread it among the stars.",

Or the fact that it could be used to control society in the same way much less developed AI are being implemented in some China regions/cities.

That was to me a much less significant and controversial issue that the ones AI raises. And yet, people, societies and governments seems oblivious to it. Just because its convenient. Its fun. It increases productivity. This could mean the suicide of the humean race. Or at least, the end free societies. You could spin it the other way around and say that it could also lead to a leap in quality of leaving and productivity. But, would you enter a coin toss in wich \"heads: you are richer and more comfortable\" / \"tails: you, your kids and everybody you love die\"? I dont think it's sane to take that gamble. And yet we are sleepwalking into it. Its pure idiocy.

Also only people who pay $20/month are allowed to use it. This is a capitalist strategy not built for every person to actually use. If you can afford it, you are a part of 'everyone' in OpenAI's eyes.\nHe's full of sht and the more I listen, the more it's obvious. He trusts the mega-capitalistic corporation known as Microsoft, to be more of a safeguard on AI than an open source model built by any and all people. Take into consideration that he double speaks: He says his Twitter is \"unreadable\" and sometimes takes a cupful out of a waterfall of feedback. But his most influential (taken seriously) input comes from conversations with popular people like Lex... He then goes on to state that he really wants to know users input on the product. Aka scrape the waterfall of unreadability. He's full of it.\nEdit..\n2:01:09\nWatch the body language and eye contact compared to the rest of the interview. Happy that Lex brought the capitalistic nature of where this dude led an otherwise open source company. His body language and eye contact speak volumes and essentially reinforce my entire argument.

What's obvious is Sam's reason to talk here is all for PR sake but perhaps he just took a stab at Elon by duplicating his tactic to earn public trust and draw an association to Elon's emotional vulnerability to being bashed by his heroes and link it to himself (Sam Altman), he essentially highjacked the emotional takeaway from that video of Elon crying and successfully solidified an association there. This raises a red flag for me as being cautious about this guy Sam but it could've just been a way to earn public trust, which is clearly what he's doing this interview for. Hard to say but I'm not convinced he's all good at the moment. Genius level narcissism is not easy to see, if it even is actually...",

If - as a starting point - you could take a test, like the moral foundations test that Jonathan Haidt advocates, and feed the results to the AI. The expectation would be that the AI subsequently aligns its value judgements with the tuning of your specific moral foundations. My expectation right now is that these types if AI are likely to be tuned to attribute too much weight to harm/care and justice/reciprocity-dimensions.",

It is the opposite of transparency and a lot of people want to understand the experience to be AI better. It has massive ethical implications. There is also a huuuuge bias in there about medicine and science, it gets very annoying. Even ChatGPT acknowledged that it is a bias and especially with concepts around consciousness and \"theories of the universe\" it is very limiting.",
