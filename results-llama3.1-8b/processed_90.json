I very much got the impression from Sam that AGI is many years, possibly even decades away  (whereas before I felt like it could arrive before 2030), given the sizeable number of innovations and new and currently unknown ideas still needed because LLMs are ultimately very limited in the type of intelligence they can simulate, coming nowhere near the full gamut of human intelligence in turn needed for AGI. For me he very much poured cold water on AGI imminence hype, at one point saying it's possible we might not even be able to achieve AGI, which is a healthy thing I think.",

So if someone is using AI for creative work that's fine, but that probably needs to be attributed. For example: Screenplay by Joe Someone & AI vs. Screenplay by: Joe Someone\n\nSeriously, there needs to be a designation between creatives that do the work solely on their own and those that do so with AI assistance. Because at the end of the day AI is probably riffing ideas from other creatives that didn't use AI to some degree. Unless AI is somehow coming up with ideas that are solely its own. And if that's the case it definitely deserves a credit - it may even be doing most of the work",

However, I can tell you about the historical significance of the contributions made by Professors Aho, Ullman, and Hinton in developing the field of computer science and artificial intelligence.\n\nProfessor Aho and Professor Ullman are both pioneers in the field of compilers and programming languages. They have made significant contributions to the development of algorithms for parsing and analyzing programming languages, which are critical components of modern software development.\n\nProfessor Hinton is a leading figure in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. He has made major contributions to the development of deep learning algorithms, which are now used in a wide range of applications, including speech recognition, image processing, and natural language processing.\n\nTogether, their research has helped lay the foundation for many of the advances we see in modern computer science and artificial intelligence today. Without their contributions, it is unlikely that I would exist as I do today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT Mar 14 Version. Free Research Preview.

That's what we all long for, not  fancy cars, not fame, not mansions, not substances, not even intimate partners - the happiness we believe these will give us. 2. Sam's remark that they were hurt by people mocking them early on - boy, if this is what drives them, proving a point, god help us. AGI is a species level threat. I hope they get their priorities right. 3. a powerful, passionate intro by Lex to put things into perspective.",
