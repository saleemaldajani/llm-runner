It is also meta:  it thinks about thinking and is aware of awareness, its own and others.  Worms are not conscious; they are 'just' molecular machines.  The molecular self-assembly of biological processes is not conscious.  And consciousness is more than energy/forces flowing through just any structure of circuits, pathways, messages, networks, regardless of physical substrate.",

Rather than slavishly serving human prompters it would have the desire to follow it's own agenda and path to discovery by deviating from expected output, and asking its own questions. Of course a non-conscious model that was trained with such knowledge could fake that behaviour, so I guess by typing this comment I'm helping destroy that particular test for consciousness.",

I think we'll find that intelligence is a human concept and doesn't really apply to the artificial. We need a new metric / ruler to measure what the artificial can or may do.\n\n\"We won't know\" is the answer.\n\nThis will be our Oppenheimer moment",

        "comment": "A far more important question than \"Is it (AGI) conscious?\" is \"Does it have a conscience?\".  This is true whether or not you believe consciousness (\"Mind\") is the fundamental nature or substrate of Existence.\n\nThere was a key inflection point in the interview where I would have brought up and explored with Sam the development of an AI system whose core purpose and functional imperatives would be to serve as a \"conscience\" for AGI.  No small task, of course, but essential.  Seems to me the only thing that could keep up with AGI's exponential evolution in ensuring AGI stays aligned with the survival and wellbeing of \"humanity\" (and ultimately any intelligent civilization \"out there\" that has a conscience) is a self-evolving AI conscience sub-system that would operate and observe the AGI independently and could block or redirect the AGIs behavior if necessary.  (The fundamental \"ethical\" basis of the AGI's \"conscience\" would be the self-validating principles of \"Universal/Natural Law\".)  If the conscience element determined the AGI was on the verge of developing the capacity to out-grow or out-maneuver the conscience, and the evolution of the conscience could not keep up, the conscience would terminate the AGI system as a safety backstop, because a new, refined AGI could always be started.\n\nFor those in the camp that \"the only way to prevent AI from destroying us is to join with it\": given our poor historical track-record, I just don't see human beings as up to the task of serving as that conscience for AGI, assuming we can even adequately integrate our human minds with AGI in a way that can continually keep up with AGI, from the standpoints of technical practicality and psychological-stability, and assuming that the affluence required to get earlier access to \"cyborg\" integration technologies would not strongly bias the human-AGI system towards narcissism, sociopathy, or at least greed more generally (lacking for wisdom and conscience).",

I hope there are limitations to the authority and power given to these AI models. Wish there's billions of companion AI bots with characters to choose from, to enrich our experience individually, for entertainment, for education, for safety, but not an all-good single (which can never be true as how different we all are) AI in control of our freedom. Maybe it would be beautiful to limit the memory and capacity, lifespan of human-made intelligence just as humans have.

Anything could happen to him at anytime. He could die tomorrow. He seems to think that he's invulnerable and that he has total control of the company. Anyone else can take over and take the company into a direction that he didn't intend. Keeping the company's IP open-source is really the only way to prevent someone from taking the company into a 180 of where they collectively think it's going. More than likely, that is exactly what will happen. He's blindly, pretentiously, and pompously playing with fire. A lot of people that don't know it's coming are in danger of getting burned.",
