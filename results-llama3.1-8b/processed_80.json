English is spoken by a large proportion of the world's population, and is used in many different countries and contexts, providing a diverse and extensive data set for training AI models. Additionally, the dominance of English-speaking countries in AI research and development means that there is a wealth of talent and expertise available in the language.\n\nIn contrast, the popularity of the Chinese language could present some challenges for AI development in China. While Chinese is the most spoken language in the world, it is primarily spoken in China and a few other countries, limiting the availability of diverse and high-quality data for training AI models. Additionally, restrictions on freedom of speech and creativity in China could hinder the development of truly innovative and versatile AI tools, as experimentation and risk-taking are essential for creativity and innovation.",

We should never lose sight of the fact that as biological beings, we have existed in our current form for a fairly short time compared to the history of life on this planet. Then from that point of comprehension, acknowledge the comparative levels of intelligence we see in some other species that have also been on this biological evolutionary journey.\n\nWe are the clear outlier, and orders of magnitude more capable in the application of our intelligence, but consciousness is not purely the preserve of the human condition. Like intelligence it seems to have levels to it in the biological story around us, so it appears related to the general evolutionary process that is the history of life on this planet.\n\nAs humans we evolved the best 'user interface', our ability to communicate, and that must have contributed to our position of dominance in the evolutionary biological tree.",
