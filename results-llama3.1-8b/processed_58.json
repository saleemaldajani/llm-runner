        "comment": "Sam's a rat. As much as I think the word lazy is primarily weaponized against people who are trapped by a bunch of bullshit to handwave away the financial crimes committed against them constantly that keeps them in bad situations, the way Sam, and others in the LLM business, run and sell their companies and products is indicative of the pure, unadulterated laziness that can only be spawned by a bunch of assholes having blank checks handed to them constantly.\n\nLLMs could have been first and foremost turned towards solving a bunch of big and very difficult problems that would have positive material impact on peoples' lives. Things like translation and complex data driven research, put in the hands of people who can and will check the model's work and who are capable of discerning where or not what its giving them is valuable. But that would be much harder, and much less profitable to him and people like him with a big financial stake in the game.\n\nInstead he looked at the potential to profit and that tech has been pointed specifically towards typical bullshit \"disruption\" of existing markets and workforces, which always results in tax payer money in rich peoples' pockets and worse experiences for normal people. And what do we have for that? A bunch of complex auto-complete systems shitting out lies constantly being falsely sold as \"artificial intelligence\", all of them based on data that was harvested without consent or much in the way of concern for quality or content. The only thing Sam's done is turn a bunch of stuff people have done with no expectation of generating profit or being profited off of into a revenue stream.\n\nHe hasn't revolutionized anything. He's just walked into a metaphorical public park, dug up all the flowers when no one was looking, and rolled up to the flea market to sell them back. The only thing only effect his non-tools that he calls AI are capable of achieving is the displacing of people financially for the benefit of large corporations. Just like Uber and Doordash displaced delivery and taxi drivers, and Amazon and Walmart displaced small local business before them. Worse lives for a bunch of people so that Sam Altman and everyone riding his coattails can get in on the same grift that every other startup has attempted to pull over the last decade.\n\nThe same variety of fetid VC con, but someone's glued some wires to the outside of the box this time and convinced a bunch of losers its then next big thing. \"Waah, we're misunderstood.\" Nah, asshole, people understand plenty. They understand that what you're trying to do is make a bunch of normal peoples' lives harder so you can make a quick buck. They understand that you don't give a damn if your \"tools\", which is a generous descriptor for them, do incalculable damage to the lives and livelihoods of people who aren't you as long as you cover your ass in regards to ones who are an actual financial threat to you - i.e. celebrities and politicians. Zero interest in turning these endeavors towards actually productive ends, as long as you can sit around like every other hollowed out tech ghoul and dismiss criticism with the classic \"if we didn't do it some worse would\" line, like you aren't the someone worse for deploying these systems like this in the first place.\n\nMan's got a black pit at the core of his soul, and there's no amount of mocking of him or his company that can ever offset via discomfort the damage he's already done.",

Maybe the FB feed is biased to show such wording, because it silences and punishes free speech advocates who very much are fine with every world view among consenting adults. A massive number of us are perfectly fine with Facebook showing you (adults) anything within the adult sphere, and we have no interest in imposing our world view on others. Meanwhile there is clearly a large number of people who are truly afraid of information that contradicts their world view, and they react to it by seeking it's removal. Even when it's only an A to B conversation, people quickly block anyone who dares defy their world view. This is rationally irrefutable proof that such people aren't generally concerned about the radicalization of others, but rather they fear the uncertainty of questioning one's own fundamental axioms.\n\nThere most certainly isn't a near universal preference to \"regulate other people's speech\". The idea that this is \"normal\" is another blind belief pushed by the New Religion. By depicting this massive section of humanity (free speech advocates) as non-existent or \"marginal\" or \"hypocritical\", adherents of this new religion can convince the gullible ones to minimize the concept of free speech as \"fringe\".",

Arms crossed, very defensive, reminiscing about how OpenAI has been mocked, then saying \u201cwe don\u2019t get mocked as much now!\u201d With the stoic arrogance of a Zuckerberg. Imagine a kid who has been mocked and bullied who realizes he now has the power of a supervillain at his fingertips. This guy has been playing with unbridled GPT4 since 2022, before ChatGPT was even announced. Imagine what he\u2019s toying around with right now.",

The quote is meant to be humorous, but it also reflects the idea that computers should be easy to use and understand.\n\nThe iMac was designed to be a user-friendly computer, and it did not need a handle to be carried. The iMac was also designed to be a modular computer, which means that it could be easily repaired or upgraded. This made it less likely that the iMac would need to be thrown out the window.\n\nSteve Jobs did not add a handle to the back of the iMac, but he did make the iMac easy to carry and easy to repair.\n\n-Bard\n\n2) There is no evidence that Steve Jobs ever made this statement regarding the handle on the iMac. The quote is often attributed to Alan Kay, a computer scientist who worked on the development of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) in the 1960s and 1970s. The addition of the handle to the iMac was likely a practical design choice, rather than a reflection of Jobs' distrust of computers.\n\n-Apo\n\n3) ChatGPT 4 still thinking...",
