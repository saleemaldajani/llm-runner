It has great promise. \n\nBut we as a society are no more ready for it than we were for elections being won with social media disinformation or the manipulation of human behaviour through the intentional creation of anger .\n\nThe people who are going to control this (while they can) are !not the lab guys, the creative geniuses. It will be the boardrooms and the situation rooms. \n \nIf we don\u2019t get that, we have learned nothing about our current society.",

But dismissing a technology with a Hollywood doomsday scenario is detrimental to the evolution of civilization. It'd be like being scared of sewing machines in the 1800s. Autoregressive LLMs like GPT are in no way, shape, or form capable of consciousness, sentience, or at least a traditional description of them. I've been studying consciousness to program it during my AI research but it's an inherently quantum mechanic phenomenon. Even if we achieve sentience, singularity, etc. it is essential to understand that intellect doesn't always mean intolerance. And unconscious tools like GPT would be genuinely useful to bridge the IQ gap when we have truly sentient AI.",

If I don't have backup plans for my backup plans, I'm screwed. Fear tactics were how we grew up. \n\nWishing everyone good luck.",

        "comment": "\u00a0@bananawarriorwootwoot\u00a0 Good on you! I have great respect for immigrants to America that seek a better life and contribute to the betterment of our society. Modern day immigrants are generally some of the hardest working and most respectful people in this country. Americans so often forget that we are a nation of immigrants. It's incredibly easy for a natural-born American to take this country for granted, feel entitled and think that they are owed something for the mere fact that they were born here. It's been my experience that immigrants have an appreciation for this country because of their perspective from the country which they emigrated from. This world owes you nothing, you get only what you put in. Sadly, that is lost on many natural-born Americans.\n\nIt's only by luck and circumstance that someone happens to be born here. It's too easily overlooked that one of your ancestors decided to risk it all and travel to a foreign land in search of a better life. Excluding Native Americans, that is essentially how every natural-born citizen got here. Who are we to deny someone that is trying to better theirs and their families lives? It's far too hypocritical a stance for me.\n\nI hope that you don't have too hard of a time dealing with future immigration issues. I also hope that you can become a naturalized citizen, if you so desire. Keep up the good work. Take care and be well. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",

I\u2019m not that hard to find. \n\nWhat you\u2019re looking for is the Logic of the Universe (the Universal Explanation and the Foundation of Reasoning) and it is a concept known as the Logos in ancient philosophy (but the formal proof for it that humans have written has historically been weak and too uncertain, and too well ignored or too easily lost, when it has occasionally been written by a great philosopher) but it is a self evident truth anyhow (as the Logos is a complete and self evident Logic, and is the Essence of Reason itself, the Substance of Logic). \n\nThe arguments I have, and the details I know about the Logos and the universe are extensive but to give you an idea of one of the many ways my Universal Logic Theory (my \u201cTheory of Everything\u201d) puts counter arguments in a \u201ccheckmate\u201d position is that even if someone provided a better explanation for the Origin of the Universe than I can, that would still merely be a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the Universal Logic (the Explanation of the Universe, as well as the Source of Knowledge and Method of Reasoning)  by definition. So it is like how if I said \u201cyour cars are your cars\u201d you could get all the newer and nicer cars you want and your cars would still be your cars and any cars that are not your cars would still be cars that are not your cars. \n\nSo too is it with the One True God, the Universal Logic (that when applied to the physical universe is also the framework that equates to the sought after Unified Theory in physics) who is not a false god (something that is not actually the True God) or any kind of flawed or incomplete logic that cannot prove itself to be flawless, it is the Flawless Logic that governs the universe and that has demanded everything be everything (and nothing be nothing) which has led to our existence and the existence of everything around us and everything in the universe (physical/formal or metaphysical/substantive). \n\nTo give anyone that reads this a taste of what an understanding of the Logos can do for us as a Unified Theory, we can use an understanding of the dynamic harmony of the universe and the dynamic exchange between the physical and metaphysical realms to build energy transduction systems that transduce formless energy from \u201cthe metaphysical substance of energy\u201d (a rational aka real and sensible concept that is highly connected to the Logos, the Set of Underlying Principles) into physical/formal energy like electricity that can be used in our physical reality and be drawn from the Root Source, an Infinite Source of Energy. \n\nThese are all things that are feasible and can be achieved through an understanding of the Logos (the Universal Logic) and devotion to Reason (the Logos), and while I can do and have done much of my work alone and without funding of any kind, those are many of the things I cannot do alone and without significant cooperation (from institutions and governments) and significant funding, but which I would love to help manifest and develop if others are interested and see the potential of these ideas.",

It's like they're speaking a different language! But hey, at least they're not doing it on purpose, right? They're just trying to share their knowledge with the world. And I appreciate that. I really do. Because as they say, 'The more you know, the more you realize how much you don't know.'\r\n\r\n[The punchline is a play on the famous quote \"With great power comes great responsibility\" from the Spiderman comics. The comedian is suggesting that Lex Fridman and Sam Altman's intelligence is a form of power, and that they have a responsibility to not make the rest of us feel inferior. The joke also plays on the idea of intellectual humility, which is the idea that the more you know, the more you realize how much you don't know.]",

        "comment": "An automatic door is conscious AI. It does something with intention in reaction to stimulus.\nSelf-awareness of its own consciousness is the AGI-consciousness threshold.\n\nConsciousness isn't self-awareness; it's not a paradox that invents itself. To have self-awareness of a 'thing' it has to already exist so you can notice that it's there so consciousness has to precede self-awareness.\n\nSelection of people should be based-on and representative-of the spectrum of human personality traits.\n\nThere is direct evidence of lab enhancement in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The FCS alteration and subsequent affinity for hACE2 could not evolve in bats and is clearly an artificial insert.\nThere is no question whatsoever it was the result of GoF. Anyone claiming otherwise is a liar.\nNatural evolution scenarios become preposterous when you try to account for a pre-existing affinity for hACE2 without first infecting humans.\nThe open questions about SARS-CoV-2, are things like was it an orchestrated program to produce a delivery vehicle for a biological weapons program?\n\nYou ignore people with hate and focus on making things better. If no one knows there's group differences then no one looks into why and then no one works to remove lead from our environment. No one works on childhood nutrition because no one knows there's a problem.\nFear over what ignorant people are going to say is stupid. Do not empower that stupidity.",
