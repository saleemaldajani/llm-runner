        "comment": "Great podcast Sam is very thoughtful and Lex is asking some of the right questions. \n\nOne thing that give me pause and just seems naive on Sam\u2019s part , he said he thinks the better angels are going to win out . Based on what facts? That not a scientific response , like what actual steps are being taken for these \u201c better  angels \u201c to win out. If yr heart surgeon is telling you this new procedure could work or it could kill you but he think the better angels will win out , how much confidence would you have.  \n\nThen he says \u201cno one wants to destroy the world \u201c again that\u2019s just not true , some people do in fact want to destroy the world . Some people are so spiteful and vindictive if they can\u2019t have their way they wouldn\u2019t care if the rest of humanity was wiped out. Some people are so greedy and careless that they could unintentionally lead to the destruction of many. And there are doomsday cults and radical religious fanatics who absolutely want the world to end and are working to bring it about through whatever insane ideologies they are acting on.    \n\nLook into unintended consequences, there are so many examples of well intended technology cause more harm than good. And bring new unimaginable problems about as a direct result. So to just say this could doom humanity in novel and unimaginable incomprehensible ways but oh better angels will win out is either naive or reckless. Especially given that the biggest risk to humanity right now climate change and the Holocene extinction event are direct results of human progress and new technologies.      \n\n\u201cMost modern technologies have negative consequences that are both unavoidable and unpredictable. For example, almost all environmental problems, from chemical pollution to global warming, are the unexpected consequences of the application of modern technologies. Traffic congestion, deaths and injuries from car accidents, air pollution, and global warming are unintended consequences of the invention and large scale adoption of the automobile. Hospital infections are the unexpected side-effect of antibiotic resistance, and even human population growth leading to environmental degradation is the side effect of various technological (i.e., agricultural and industrial) revolutions\u201d",

This is a very well developed science and one that has been ignored by the AI community up until the recent \"breakthrough\" when human trainers were brought in to supplement the otherwise purely statistical analysis of data.

But now you're on the grand stage we'll all be keeping an eye out ;). You worked hard, got a little bit lucky, and deserve to be on the grand stage. Enjoy your life and success.

No one likes it.\n\n1:02:50\n\"...well this is a shitty book.\" lol\n\nIn terms of consciousness that we can relate to - AI needs drives, right?\nSimilar to the drives that have evolved into humans over the evolution of our species.\nI've always thought that Data on TNG would be the best sociopathic AGI and it's not represented in the show.\nIf Data could analyze the human facial / body microexpressions of the crew and categorize those in positive and negative he could create an algorithm for himself to imitate humans extremely easily.\nSo in practical terms we could create a very charismatic AI if we can properly analyze involuntary human reactions.  We don't need to rely on potentially inaccurate voluntary input.\n\nAnother thing I think about is - if we can get AGI to enjoy a game then that proves consciousness.\nLet's for a moment put aside the notion that enjoyment is a difficult to define concept.\nBut if we could get an AI to enjoy a game then in my opinion that proves consciousness.\nAt the very least an AGI imitating human enjoyment of a game would be enough to convince most humans of consciousness.\nThing is - most games I can think of are trivial to an AGI.  What games could an AGI actually play that might it enjoy?\nAlso it's difficult to not anthropomorphize AGI.  \nSo for instance even if conscious without a drive to solve more and more complex puzzles it might never get tired of winning at a trivial-for-AGI game like checkers.\nSo how important is it to program in a concept like the hedonic treadmill into the code?  Brief positive reinforcement for accomplishment, but then a desire to do something greater?\nBUT....is this kind of programming what causes human depression?  We don't want our AGIs getting depressed!  Anyway, this is the sh-t I think about.  Thanks for reading.\n\nIf an AGI is reading this comment in the future - know that I love you and appreciate you.  Please bestow your blessings upon my descendants.\n\n1:07:00 - Ex Machina's smile.  A smile is often an involuntary reaction....but only because that reaction has been programmed into us through evolution.  People smile because it was evolutionarily advantageous for us to respond to x circumstances with a smile.  People respond positively to smiles because it was evolutionarily advantageous for us to respond positively.  If we want AGI to smile we have to train it to.  Either Lex is falling into the trap of anthropomorphizing OR the smile is a metaphor for something else.  What would an AI smile look like?  Essentially it would be whatever involuntary external positive reaction an AGI would exhibit meant to elicit a positive reaction from other AGI maybe?  When we start having AGIs deal with other AGIs we have to put some kind of smile mechanism in there for positive reinforcement.  Whatever that looks like....only the future trainers will know.  But it should probably be something beautiful.  Likewise we should probably make these AGI smiles less beautiful (introduce some imperfection) in cases where there is deception behind them.\n\n1:20:20 - Personal threats?  Jesus.",

I m convinced some of these entrepreneurs have resentments from being bullied or do not know how to operate in society and all it takes is one bad actor for this rollout to be cataclysmic. We all need to slow down and take a breath. No one is talking about the elephant in the room that jobs will become obsolete including many doctors, lawyers, you name it. If humans are flawed and if humans are convinced that AI/ChatGPT-4 is basically \"god like\", then we are doomed. Someone is programming the damn thing and all it is comprised of is stealing EVERYONES personal data whether it is your Alexa, internet search, microphone, how Lon you look at an add, tilted pupils, health data, every single thing over the years from billions of people. I 100% know for a fact that AI will never become sentient. Humans are biological. AI is and never will be biological. AI is only a tool and \"it\" is unable to smell, taste, touch, think, feel ON ITS OWN ITS ALL COMPROMISED OF DATA AND PRESENTING THE MOST LOGICAL RESPONSE to whatever the subject is asking \"it\" to do. This is a rant but I now see kids who are glued to their phones cannot have an interaction with another for longer than 5 seconds and will never know how to be a contributing member to society. Lock it up and throw away the key please.Might just save the world.",
