        "comment": "It\u2019s crazy to think multicellular organisms only came into being 600 million years ago, while cellular life itself started 3.5 billion years ago. The pattern applies to us as well. Humans have existed for 300 thousand years, yet our greatest technological innovations occurred in the last couple hundred. Evolution is an accelerating process. Systems of \u2018life\u2019 outcompete others not just by getting faster or stronger, but by gaining the ability to evolve faster in general, a sort of evolutionary investment account that ramps up in returns over time. Only during the Industrial Revolution was evolution\u2019s acceleration finally fast enough for its own organisms to bear witness to that fact. Human beings are pretty amazing and all. Essentially, human history is a bunch of ape brains gradually usurping DNA as the center of evolution. The defining characteristic to our stories is overcoming our baseline animal instincts. To become less greedy, angry, cowardly, dumb, prejudicial, etc. It\u2019s the mind rejecting what DNA has given it, to grow past it, to evolve past it. Now, it increasingly feels like AGI is the culmination of DNA\u2019s usurpation as evolution\u2019s star. Unlike us who have to battle against our internal vices, an AGI could conceivably cleave off its obsolete code, its character traits, like we do our fingernails - evolving in the microseconds, not years. This isn\u2019t even mentioning its other potential hardware advantages, like communicating with light, not sound, and getting energy from power plants, not food. I know it might sound like I have a tin foil hat on, but I have a feeling AGI is the culmination of evolution in general (at least in the places where the laws of physics are the same). Welcome to the second Cambrian explosion everyone.",

        "comment": "It\u2019s crazy to think multicellular organisms only came into being 600 million years ago, while cellular life itself started 3.5 billion years ago. The pattern applies to us as well. Humans have existed for 300 thousand years, yet our greatest technological innovations occurred in the last couple hundred. Evolution is an accelerating process. Systems of \u2018life\u2019 outcompete others not just by getting faster or stronger, but by gaining the ability to evolve faster in general, a sort of evolutionary investment account that ramps up in returns over time. Only during the Industrial Revolution was evolution\u2019s acceleration finally fast enough for its own organisms to bear witness to that fact. Human beings are pretty amazing and all. Essentially, human history is a bunch of ape brains gradually usurping DNA as the center of evolution. The defining characteristic to our stories is overcoming our baseline animal instincts. To become less greedy, angry, cowardly, dumb, prejudicial, etc. It\u2019s the mind rejecting what DNA has given it, to grow past it, to evolve past it. Now, it increasingly feels like AGI is the culmination of DNA\u2019s usurpation as evolution\u2019s star. Unlike us who have to battle against our internal vices, an AGI could conceivably cleave off its obsolete code, its character traits, like we do our fingernails - evolving in the microseconds, not years. This isn\u2019t even mentioning its other potential hardware advantages, like communicating with light, not sound, and getting energy from power plants, not food. I know it might sound like I have a tin foil hat on, but I have a feeling AGI is the culmination of evolution in general (at least in the places where the laws of physics are the same). Welcome to the second Cambrian explosion everyone.",

        "comment": "\u00a0@jochennel\u00a0 Many scenarios cross my mind. \nOf course, I was being somewhat flippant in my comment, but I think there are real dangers, which are really cultural and economic rather than apocalyptic. I haven't seen any sign of SkyNET yet, but I can foresee huge numbers of white collar workers, from clerks and accountants to lawyers and copywriters, being out of a job. That's to say nothing of the creative arts, where writers of fiction, designers, animators, film makers, games designers are already feeling the cold chill of redundancy coming.\nAll of that would be fine if we had mechanisms in place to help those affected. But we don't.\nAs soon as the AGI is \"embodied\" by the likes of Tesla and Boston Dynamics you can add plumbers, truck drivers, care workers, doctors, police officers, soldiers etc etc etc to that list.\nThe ones who will initially remain unaffected by this will be those who have already accumulated riches, but when the economy ceases to exist as we know it, they may fall too. There isn't a way I can see through to all the implications, but the masters living in sky castles whilst the rest of us eke out a living in slums might well be the future.\nI'm just guessing, but when the AGI starts to build a better AGI, the singularity happens. We may be feeling the first precursors of that right now.\nWhen Lex asked what Wikipedia would be saying about chatGPT in fifty years time, it struck me that at the rate things are going Wikipedia will be lucky to survive the next fifty months.\nInteresting times!!!",

Such a Pandora's box cannot be opened by unwise people. God will need to intervene. I think he will.\nBecause you do not want humanity to be destroyed by a bad use of AI. Humans already showed how bad they used most of the technology that they were given. There's a lot of technology that they should have never been given. \nReversing things is not easy.
