If you want to be heard, you have to dare to come out as the individual human you are. We also need blockchain media that is already provided with an ID in the camera and can be traced from recording to broadcast, because presumably AIs will be able to spit out photo-realistic videos as early as next year (or next month...). Of course, you can't just roll out something like that, but you'd have to start as soon as possible.",

        "comment": "i got an answer from Chat GPT-4: If an AI language model like ChatGPT were able to predict the future with 100% accuracy, it would raise intriguing questions about the Simulation Hypothesis. Specifically, it would suggest that the universe we are living in is indeed a simulated construct, and that the laws of physics and the course of events are predetermined by the simulation's creators.\r\n\r\nThis is because, under the Simulation Hypothesis, the universe we perceive as real is actually a digital construct created by a more advanced civilization. If an AI language model were able to predict the future with perfect accuracy, it would imply that the simulation's creators had complete knowledge and control over the events that unfold within the simulated universe.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is important to note that the Simulation Hypothesis is still a matter of speculation and debate, and there is no conclusive evidence to prove or disprove it. Furthermore, even if an AI language model were able to make accurate predictions, it would not necessarily imply that we are living in a simulation, as there may be other explanations for its predictive abilities.",

This way a social \"computing\" can evaluate a truth more precisely. Of course, \"can\" isn't equal to \"is\" every time and case.",

For instance the clear positions Bill Gates had during the pandemic in regards to free movement and pro-pharma/ pro-centralized power, he was espousing. There are too many parallels with The World Economic Forum type agendas in regards to population/resource control ect..  to not be talking more about oversight, with such a power as AGI emerging. If it is orders of magnitude smarter than us(which it obviously is) it can deceive the population of the likes we have never seen and likely without being perceived. And who has the controls? Who are we trusting with the code? We should be having more people participating on the questions of if we should even be moving forward with this. And the government is not the answer. We see what they do. It should definitely be open source. \n\n I feel like those type of questions where avoided here. A kind of kid gloved interview and a bit bias to a pro-AI-takeover type of world view. Not enough talk about oversight as well as what was supposed to be an open source/not for profit organization. Elon even made a comment that he was shocked that shortly after he gave 100 million to the not for profit open AI, that Microsoft moved in and the company is now a \"for profit entity\". I would have liked to see more objective criticism of issues like these and less band wagon/ silicon valley start-up type woo from this interview. This is the most important junction in the history of humanity. Let's act like it please. Love you",

Some impressions of Altman:\n\n- Smart, thoughtful, oddly humble and introverted for a Silicon Valley CEO, has that thousand-yard stare only people who've been introduced to the inner sanctum of America's super-spooky surveillance state possess (like he's been given a guided tour of hell and met Satan himself).\n\n- His justification for letting the creature/monster/entity/alien out to play and soil its nappies in public is more or less plausible: it's better to find out how evil this thing is while it's still too weak to go full Skynet on us so we might learn how to chain the beast.\n\n- You can tell he's dying to go full utopian tech bro, but again, he's already been shown how the American imperium intends to use his baby to cover the world in perpetual darkness, so his enthusiasm is muted and tempered with a kind of melancholy\n\nOverall, I think whatever anyone's personal opinion is of this cultural moment of the introduction of true AI/AGI into mainstream society, this is a milestone in history. It's an incredible thing, like aliens have landed and are offering us wondrous superpowers but we very sensibly do not trust them.",

        "comment": "Hi Lex,\nthanks for the talk. Got to have some great insights.\nAt 1:19:45, when Sam asks whether they should open-source GPT-4, I think you could have agreed with that, because open-source gives powers to everyone, and the power will not be concentrated in a single company or people no matter how good they are. Further if there are exploits or bad uses, the collective good of open source can help fight that.",
