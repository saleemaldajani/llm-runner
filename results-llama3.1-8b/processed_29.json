Some people have accused him of being a fascist, while others have defended him as a defender of free speech and individual rights.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that accusations of fascism are serious and should not be made witho\nut evidence or a thorough understanding of the person's beliefs and actions. It is always best to do your own research and draw your own conclusions based on credible sources and evidence.\"",

A way to consider this, is that commerce, or the act of making commerce, is an innate human activity, it's the exchange of information/culture/ideas/products, and every civilization that had a modicum of success did it. Soviets tried to remove it, it's akin to saying you can't speak to your neighbour. Of course it failed.",

The major difference is more manipulated data, or human guidance, how you want to call it, in the form of RLHF. This still does not make a reasonable AGI. Just the mimicry of human reason is more filtered and tuned.",

There was a very interesting episode of Nova where one of the researchers stated that that had been mathematically proven.\n\nAs far as using AI as a tool, there is always temptation to use a wrench as a hammer, and there will always be bad actors that will use a hammer as a weapon.  We are as dangerous to each other as any AI could be.  Having said that, I have to say that when I was growing up and read science fiction skynet scenarios, I felt contempt for the character\u2019s Frankenstien syndrome.  Now I am feeling it myself.\n\nAs far as the comments about people on facebook not wanting their own comments censored, but worrying about other people\u2019s ideas, if you are afraid of what I might think after hearing an opposing view, you aren\u2019t afraid of opposing views, you are afraid of me thinking. This is the intention of the PC speech movement.  The founding fathers covered all this in their writings.  Too bad it isn\u2019t taught in schools anymore.",
