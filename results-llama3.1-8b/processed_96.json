However, I would also argue that there may be many types of consciousness, and I would ask you to consider this: a cow is conscious but not necessarily intelligent in the way we think of intelligence as humans. If a cow was imbued with human-level intelligence, would its consciousness be the same as ours? An animal that is hardwired to love the herd, to be part of the herd, to live off the land, and not to be predatorial, to see strength in numbers. Would a cow\u2019s consciousness, combined with intelligence, be the same as ours? In my opinion, no. So why would we assume that an intelligent machine that is not dependent on killing to survive and that has met its creator would have a consciousness that predisposed itself as ours does?",
