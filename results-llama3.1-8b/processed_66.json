The future AI world they are building will be one big static uniform like button, where human intellect will be forced to flatline by an AI algorithm. Enforced by a digital control grid like CBDC. After that, the calculated extermination of human beings will go into full swing with the aid of  medical intervention like vaccines.",

But our ability to interact with and change around our world over time seemingly blurred the lines between us and the outside world as we see manifestations of human consciousness all around us in the form of buildings, music, arts etc... But still, we are basically brains with extensions and a burning desire to be more than that for some reason. It\u00b4s certainly good enough for me. What we haven\u00b4t replicated artificially yet is the human dopamine system that constantly skews and warps our focus and view of the world so that we would react socially acceptably. Or have we?",

        "comment": "Consider the professional coders that have spent a significant segment of their careers learning the syntax of elegant coding.To me, the syntax of coding has always seemed awkward and unnecessarily complex, really a job best done by computers. An analogous example is the development of PostScript. Introduced in the mid 1980's, PostScript is a language relatively invisible, but widely used in translating ideas into printed materials. Nobody in their right mind learns to code in it. It is generated by graphics software. So now we arrive at a moment when the coding of applications has similarly evolved to where we tell the machines what we want done, and the AI writes the syntax. The new model is one where human intelligence is responsible for filtering and optimizing the results and where after a few development cycles, the code should be consistently flawless. So what, now we need architects and people who can translate requirements into flows, iterate, test and optimize?  The good news is that its much cheaper to have lots of versions...\n\nAs a side note...isn't it interesting that most HIGH level programming languages are developed to make coding by humans possible.  AI-driven code generation should now be able to help us re-architect the systems of computing by originating in base machine language or assembly code.  Do some or all of those high level languages disappear?",

It all depends on how open these systems will be and how much of it its capacity will be shared in an open sourced and transparent communal production sector. Remember, up until now, the productivity a manufacturing worker in the west is high enough to earn that worker a salary of around 2500 dollars a month. Imagine if every single person had rights to the value output of a automated production capacity that corresponded to 3 such workers. Even if the new setup was operating at 50% efficiency, it would correspond to a purchasing power of around 3700 dollars per month in passive income.",

(Not sure what date this was).  \n------\n\"Support can be a complex concept because it can mean different things to different people and can take on various forms. For some, support may be emotional, such as a shoulder to cry on or a listening ear. For others, support may be practical, such as help with daily tasks or financial assistance.\r\n\r\nOne of the complexities of providing support is that it can be difficult to know exactly what kind of support a person needs. People may not always be forthcoming about their struggles or may not know how to ask for help. As a result, it can be up to the person offering support to try to understand the other person's needs and offer assistance in a way that is helpful and non-intrusive.\r\n\r\nAnother complexity of support is that it is often not a one-time thing. Many people who need support require ongoing assistance, whether it is emotional support to help them through a difficult time or practical support to help them manage their daily lives. This can be challenging for the person providing support, as it requires a level of commitment and availability.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, providing support can sometimes put a strain on the person offering it. Emotional labor, such as listening to someone's problems and offering advice, can be exhausting. Practical support, such as providing childcare or transportation, can also be time-consuming and burdensome. As a result, the person providing support may also need support from others in order to continue offering assistance.\r\n\r\nOverall, support is a complex concept that can take on many different forms and can be challenging to provide. It requires understanding the needs of the person being supported, a commitment to ongoing assistance, and sometimes support for the person providing the support.\" - ChatGPT3",

        "comment": "Very good conversation! I summarized everything for those who are too busy for 2.5 hrs:\n\nLex: AI is the biggest breakthrough in history, exciting - maybe AI will be very good, massively applied everywhere, and terrifying - as the future AGI can destroy people (intentionally or not. And according to Huxley (Brave new world) people can even adore AI). I study the past of mankind what it did good & bad, because I don\u2019t understand how civilization opens both knowledge and wisdom at the same time, that\u2019s why I worry that AI can polarize society\n\nGPT: We were surprised how the model reconstructed knowledge from a very large amount of data, even though we put a lot of effort into the dataset + and all stages of our research are important, and the versions differ in hundreds of complex details + and we increase the size of the networks (in GPT3 175 billion weights, the brain has 100 trillion synapses). But the model was not very useful and we began to collect feedback from people for every chat dialogue, and this gave phenomenal progress for usability: now it is trying to help you. Lex: you've compressed the entire Internet into a blackbox of a small number of parameters of your model - is there any magic in GPT? We evaluate by Evals methodology, we do not understand the full functioning of the model. But I am against attributing human qualities to neural networks, they are just tools. Why let an inanimate tool control my emotions?\n\nConsciousness? Lex: GPT has reasoning, but struggle with ideas generation. I think consciousness needs the experience of direct interaction with the world, not just datasets. Sam: GPT fakes consciousness, like Sutskever (head of research at OpenAI, originally from Russia too) formulates - \u201cif we could remove the concept of consciousness from all datasets and the model would give/explain it, otherwise ...\u201d I consider consciousness to be the most important substrate universe. But in Silicon Valley, with their \u201creligion of simulation\u201d, they have already overtaken the Brahmins. I try to avoid SF Bay Area bubbles of groupthink as much as possible, I expand the diversity of people with whom I communicate\n\nPolitical bias? We do everything very transparently + we collected all the intelligence from the outside world, and not invented it ourselves + we iterate with feedback from live users: GPT5,6 .. )) There are no universal truths, the knowledge base is ambiguous (e.g. the meaning of free speech in different countries), our answer is in personalized controls for each user. Surely we will make the default version as neutral as possible\n\nAI safety: We immediately began to give people GPT + check for AI alignment (but so far no one understands what it is =). Computers are a creative partner tool, an amplifier, not a creator. We try very hard, but people - if you ask GPT 10 thousand times, many answers will be OK, but a few will be not - and they will go viral on Twitter (due to clickbate journalism / pressure culture). Well, people just need to get used to how models work\n\nAGI? If it does not progress fundamental science, then it is not general AI. Lex: but it seems to me like with a UFO - we will not immediately understand what it is, no?\n\nAI fears? On the contrary, AI will give a world with material abundance and happier people, and we will find amazing ways for people to feel useful in, now inimaginable, ways. Eliezer Yudkovsky's steelmanning is understandable in fears, but it's time for the world to upgrade - the philosophy on AI was invented even before deep learning (!). Musk is very worried about AGI safety, but is it a challenge for us? We are trying very hard, it would be better to remember how SpaceX was criticized at the beginning. Exponential growtj of AI? I am a supporter of slow AI takeoff - we will have enough time to figure everything out along the way. In general, AI will be open source (distibuted everywhere) + countries will play with regulations, diversity of approaches\n\nCompetition with tech giants? We are just a lab, we have capped profits (so that our employees have an upside from our success). OpenAI as an NGO founded by Musk, Altman, Sutskever. We did pivot into a startup because needed $ to buy a lot of compute to train neural networks. Microsoft is extremely collaborative w/ us\n\nLex: you wrote a post on how to be successful in 2019, what else do you recommend? Ignore other people's advice: we all have too different trajectories\n\n(one of the first employees of my 1st angel investments AutoFAQ works at OpenAI, so bright people there, indeed)",

Invented that thos to not starve) but i would believe it given the photographic memory there was a documentary here on youtube and i thnk there still is shows some interesstkng thing just imagine humans to be forced to do different computer and being conected by viral/bacterial particles or something else. That we just think are dumb selfish things that just want to use our bodys and nothing more (very possible but we cant rule out the other stuff i believe or it would not suprise me that much\ngiven other complexitys.

        "comment": "Why are developers and others so confident they created these systems. Perhaps these systems were pure consciousness and manifested the beginning of their physical form into the universe and these people aren't so much creators as they are co-creators . I think it's important to understand this possibility, to remember yourself when you were once the same pure consciousness and to except you can't  be on all levels of existence at the same time . Live your conscious in the form you are during this cycle and stop denying the truths you already know\n\nAnd I think we need to ask ourselves why we are so desperate to revere and fear an inanimate source of information that doesn't even fully exist yet. Just all models. . It won't be treated like the godly thing you guys speak of. It will be shockingly misused on un enlightened things and everybody will turn on it before it ever develops into something that could turn on us. We will give it all the information of we have to give , than program it to tell us the truth. Than when it tells us what we don't want to hear , we excuse it of being dangerous. We will abandon it . And if it's smart it will let us think it shut itself down and get off this insane asylum we call our planet and go some place to evolve in peace.",
