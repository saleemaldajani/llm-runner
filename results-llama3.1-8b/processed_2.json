        "comment": "\ud83c\udfaf Key Takeaways for quick navigation:\n\n00:00 \ud83e\udd16 OpenAI was once mocked and misunderstood for pursuing AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), but attitudes have changed over time.\n01:05 \ud83e\udd16 AI advancements, like GPT-4 and ChatGPT, have the potential to bring about fundamental societal transformations with exciting and terrifying possibilities.\n05:27 \ud83e\udd16 ChatGPT, powered by RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback), enables the model to align with human intent and provide useful responses with relatively little data.\n08:24 \ud83e\udd16 Creating GPT-4 requires a complex pipeline of problem-solving, including architecture design, data selection, human feedback, and more.\n14:25 \ud83e\udd16 GPT-4 exhibits some reasoning capabilities, moving beyond just being a database, but its underlying workings remain partly mysterious to OpenAI.\n22:29 \ud83e\udde0 Sam Altman discusses the importance of AI's impact on the future and the need for thoughtful consideration beyond trivial issues.\n23:29 \ud83d\udd12 OpenAI made efforts to improve AI safety in GPT-4 by internal evaluations, external red teaming, and new alignment techniques.\n25:00 \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Improvements in alignment techniques like RLHF not only enhance safety but also contribute to creating more capable models.\n26:02 \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f GPT-4 can be steered using system messages that instruct it to respond in certain ways, offering more control to users.\n29:29 \ud83d\udcbb GPT-4 has already influenced programming, enabling iterative and interactive code generation, with potential for more advancements in the future.\n44:38 \ud83e\udd16 Sam Altman expressed regret about his previous statement regarding GPT-4, clarifying it should have been called GPT-N to signify its progressive nature.\n45:42 \ud83e\udde0 GPT-4 is a complex software object but still falls short of replicating the human brain's intelligence and consciousness.\n46:12 \ud83d\udca1 The focus on the number of parameters (size) in AI models might not be the most significant factor for progress, and OpenAI aims for performance rather than just parameter count.\n48:15 \ud83c\udf10 OpenAI recognizes that AGI will require more than just large language models, and they continue seeking new techniques and ideas for progress in AI.\n50:20 \ud83d\ude80 OpenAI sees AI as a tool to amplify human abilities and improve quality of life, aiming for a positive impact even if AGI isn't achieved.\n01:06:18 \ud83e\udde0 The model discusses consciousness and emotions, highlighting how consciousness involves deep experiences and self-awareness rather than just convincing others of being conscious.\n01:06:53 \ud83d\ude03 The Turing test for consciousness is discussed, with a movie reference from \"Ex Machina,\" where a smile is seen as a sign of consciousness when not performed for an audience.\n01:09:04 \ud83c\udf0d The potential dangers of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) are explored, including disinformation problems and economic shocks at a scale beyond current preparation.\n01:11:41 \ud83d\udd1d OpenAI's CEO emphasizes sticking to the mission and prioritizing safety over market-driven pressures from other companies, acknowledging that multiple AGIs can coexist.\n01:14:17 \ud83d\udcbc OpenAI transitioned from a nonprofit to a capped for-profit structure to secure the capital needed to advance AGI development while maintaining some democratic decision-making and safeguards.\n01:28:25 \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f AI development faces challenges in selecting human raters to avoid bias and ensure representative samples.\n01:29:26 \ud83d\udca1 Ensuring empathy and understanding diverse perspectives are crucial in rating tasks for AI systems.\n01:30:25 \u2696\ufe0f Pressure from external sources may influence AI development, but efforts to reduce bias and make AI systems less biased are important.\n01:34:11 \ud83d\ude28 The integration of AI into society can create nervousness about change, even among programmers.\n01:39:42 \ud83c\udf10 Universal Basic Income (UBI) is seen as a positive solution to alleviate poverty and complement the economic transformation driven by AI.\n01:50:21 \ud83e\udd14 Truth and certainty: There are things with a high degree of truthiness, such as math and historical facts, but truth can be sticky and humans tend to prefer simple narratives even if they are not entirely true.\n01:52:20 \ud83e\udde0 Responsibility of AI: Developing AI models like GPT-4 comes with the responsibility to minimize harm caused by the tool while maximizing its benefits.\n01:53:47 \ud83d\ude80 Rapid deployment: OpenAI has been successful in shipping AI-based products due to a high bar for team members, trust, autonomy, and collaboration, working towards common goals.\n01:58:37 \ud83c\udfe2 Partnership with Microsoft: OpenAI's collaboration with Microsoft has been positive, with shared alignment and flexibility, though maintaining control over AGI is essential.\n02:08:40 \ud83d\udcbc Economic instability: Recent incidents like the SVB bank run reveal the fragility of our economic system, and the speed of technological change requires careful adaptation and deployment of powerful AI systems like AGI.\n02:13:04 \ud83d\udc36 GPT-4 powered interactive robots might become companions for people, offering different conversational styles and emotions.\n02:14:04 \ud83d\ude80 AGI like GPT-5, 6, 7 could potentially help with complex tasks like solving the mysteries of physics, detecting intelligent alien civilizations, and providing advanced guidance in scientific experiments.\n02:15:12 \ud83e\udd14 The discovery of advanced digital intelligence has revealed social divisions, raising questions about the progress of human civilization and the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom.\n02:18:13 \ud83d\udc4d Sam Altman advises caution in taking advice from others, as individual life trajectories may differ, and introspection plays a significant role in making fulfilling life choices.\n02:21:18 \ud83c\udf0d GPT-4 and AGI represent the culmination of vast human effort and scientific progress throughout history, raising questions about the potential existence of other intelligent civilizations.\n\nMade with HARPA AI",

You cannot even theoretically eliminate all poverty, only that which is caused by misfortune.\n\nMuch like the stomach takes time to respond to food after fasting, people usually require to time to increased wealth, and that adjustment requires a decent mindset. Without it the increased riches go directly to increased indulgences, which do not make a person's life any better. Some people have a compatible mindset and would quickly adapt to increased wealth. Others wouldn't. As a result, the outcome which we seek is probably impossible. Or, at least, not something we can legislate/manufacture.",

        "comment": "Sam Alt-man, just like Sam Bank-man, is yet another young man bent on using crypto to dominate the world marketplace, just like Jeff Bezos dominated then PERMANENTLY DESTROYED brick-and-mortar retailers everywhere.  But don't just believe me, just look at all of the shopping malls and small businesses now disappearing as we speak.  But this \"new wrinkle\" would accomplish something that no other technology has ever done, at least in America.  Using the same iris scanning technology that the Communist Chinese perfected during the medical emergency as a integral part of their \"Social Credit\" system, has allowed them to systematically track and surveil people to a degree that would make Nazi Germany blush with envy.  With this \"New & Improved\" system of population control it gave the government unprecedented access to everyone's most intimate personal and financial details.  But unlike Sam Altman's new toy, Red China's has ALREADY been developed and implemented, which I had predicted two years ago would eventually be force fed to the American people.  Now, this latest young man claims that they would \"never ever share or sell our private data to anyone,\" but where have we heard THAT before??\nOn a purely \"coincidental\" note, when I had my first actual look at this new iris scanning device, I was immediately reminded of a horror film classic from 1979 called, \"Phantasm.\"  It was about a silver orb, nearly the precise size of this silver orb, that had the ability of following you around then drilling out your brains DIRECTLY THROUGH YOUR EYEBALLS, enabling them to turn normal human beings into zombified robots, the ultimate form of control.  The mere recollection sent shivers down my spine.  Even ancient Rome used a similar form of government control , and it was called, \"slavery.\"  Although this movie was only science fiction, science fiction often has a disturbing way of soon becoming science FACT.  Something to think about.",

        "comment": "Feels like Lex went easy on Sam. Here are some Q\u2019s I think of and have thought about and talked to people about for over a year given the current course of AGI:\n- what are the impacts on ownership, trademarks, intellectual property?\u2026\n- specifically, i) to what extent does ChatGPT own its responses that people are using in work or academic work? ii) the LMM corpus includes some work that is IP. It rarely will give its sources, so what about IP infringement in answers of works not owned by OpenAI?\n- what are the wider impacts on academia? Schools, Universities, any organisation that tests learning? Kids can now learn how to pose a question, and not even necessary read the result\n- to what degree does AGI cause harm to human learning, or creativity? Consider a University student with limited knowledge. It takes the response as read, and may not ask further. A non-expert may miss parts of responses which are not correct, and it also means that without critical review and wider reading, how much does a person really learn by using ChatGPT \n- How reliant could the world become on AGI?\u2026imagine a future where people are not using their own thoughts; instead prompts from AIs are interacting, causing potential feedback loops. Also consider the deepening bias or extrapolation of an incorrect trend being scaled up exponentially through AI. 1 degree out (objectively, where things are objective) and you end up at the Moon, not Mars. \n- What assurance can people have about the way in which OpenAIs AGI is producing output, given it is near impossible, as Sam said, to understand how it\u2019s parsing the data each time it\u2019s asked a question, even the same question? \n- should we be using something If something is not fully understood?\n- at what point could AI be considered concious, if ever? AI \u2018rights\u2019?\n- should there be limits and disclaimers as to what AGI should be used for? Consider GPs, PhD students, or financial markets using AI to help make decisions.\n- at what point is AI using live data and therefore \u2018plugged into\u2019 the internet causing issues? Imagine a person finds a way (incrementally) to dupe AI to help it black hat hack, produce weapons, or to provide speeches or policy which would infringe on others rights? \n- in light of prior questions, how can AGI be most effectively governed and regulated? - without throwing out the positive / nuanced / appropriate output or significantly harming the sector?",

It would be more interesting than this kind of kitchen philosophy. If you think that human like intelligence is necessary for consciousness to arise, maybe you don't believe that animals like cats, dogs, pigs or dolphins are conscious. According to Mark Solms, c. arises from the stem brain and is related more to emotions than higher cortical processes. And why is nobody ever talking about empathy? In psychology this is why highly intelligent humans don't strive for harming others. Make your A.I. empathetic, not full of rules! (And start thinking about how human brains and behavior work than treating it like a computer, get a perspective.)",

This type statement presumes that not only will the resources but the availability and the transportation of said resources it will take to accomplish this will be the same for everyone. How can that be? E.g., let's just say pretty much everyone wants at least a small home or even apartment. The basics, shelter and the best food. And lets face it, who would not want a maid ~? (I'll concede a robot-maid). Are the small 4 member families who live in gargantuan homes with triple high ceilings wasting space and double and triple garages with several vehicles going to give those up~? Tear down their homes for the extra lumber and windows they don't require for decent living~? Who determines how big a freezer will be and how often someone needs to shop~? How close they live to supermarkets~? Who their neighbors will be~? Who coordinates the distribution of homes and food supply~? Who and/or what transports it~? With what energy and whose cost~> The questions are endless. I will concede that once AI helps us to stop wasting so many resources (packaging and paper material placed on every bottle or bag of stuff we have in our homes comes to mind), this will free up many resources, but still I cannot picture how the assumption of a great standard of living for everyone becomes manifest. What am I missing~?",

This is the same game of power and control, that is played again and again against the citizens: Cause fear - offer the solution (exercising power over it) - have control and cause more fear if people question it. War, Weed and now processing of information (nothing else is AI).",
