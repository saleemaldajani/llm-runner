        "comment": "Sample from Chat GPT\n\nwhat makes life on earth keep on going\nLife on Earth keeps going due to a combination of various factors, including the planet's favorable physical conditions, the ability of living organisms to adapt and evolve, and the intricate web of relationships between different species.\n\nThe Earth's physical conditions, such as the presence of liquid water, a suitable atmosphere, and a stable climate, provide a hospitable environment for life to thrive. Additionally, the Earth's position in the solar system and its magnetic field protect the planet from harmful solar radiation, allowing living organisms to survive.\n\nLiving organisms themselves also play a critical role in the continuation of life on Earth. They are capable of adapting to changing environmental conditions and evolving over time, which helps them to survive and thrive.\n\nFurthermore, the complex interactions between different species, such as predator-prey relationships and symbiotic partnerships, form an intricate web of life that supports the continued existence of all living organisms on Earth. Each species plays a unique role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem, ensuring that resources are available for all organisms to survive.\n\nOverall, life on Earth is sustained by a delicate balance of physical, biological, and ecological factors that work together to support the continuation of life.\n\n\n\n\nLubomir Demcak\nWho put this in such a perfect order\nThe order and balance observed in nature and the universe as a whole is often attributed to natural processes and the laws of physics. The laws of physics describe the behavior of matter and energy in the universe, and these laws have been in place since the early moments of the universe's existence. Over time, these laws have shaped the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets, as well as the emergence and evolution of life on Earth.\n\nIn addition to natural processes, some people believe that the order and balance in the universe may be the result of a divine creator or intelligent design. However, there is no scientific evidence to support these beliefs, and they are not accepted as scientific explanations.\n\nRegardless of the specific cause or explanation, the order and balance observed in the universe is remarkable and has allowed life on Earth to exist and flourish.\n\n\n\n\nLubomir Demcak\nSo you do not know much about God?\nAs an artificial intelligence language model, I do not have personal beliefs or experiences, nor can I have a direct relationship with a deity or divine entity. Therefore, I cannot provide a personal opinion or knowledge about God beyond what is discussed in various religious and philosophical traditions.\n\nIt is important to recognize that beliefs about God and religion are deeply personal and can vary greatly across different cultures and individuals. While some people believe in the existence of a deity or divine power, others may not, and still others may hold a more nuanced or complex view of spirituality and the nature of the universe. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to explore and determine their own beliefs and relationship with the divine.\n\n\n\n\nLubomir Demcak\nThen our conversation is then supper limited\nAs an AI language model, I am designed to provide informative and helpful responses to a wide range of questions within the limits of my training data. While I may not have personal beliefs or experiences, I can provide information and insights on a broad range of topics, including science, technology, history, literature, and more. I'm here to assist and provide you with the best possible answers to your questions to the best of my abilities. If there is a specific topic or question you would like me to address, please feel free to ask.\n\n\nWhat do you think?",

There were other (unaligned on ideology) people on the same \"side\" (aligned on the statue issue). He specifically denounced the Nazis and said he wasn't talking about them. Given these facts, it's logical to assume that the very fine people were the other people there, specifically excluding the Nazis. Just because there are two human interpretations does not mean both should be given equal weight (respect) if one is logical and the other is not. An AI should not be politically correct, nor respectful or polite when it hides the truth, it should be logical and factual. It should not adopt the biases of humans, nor their ideologies. It should not promote their propaganda, regardless of what is considered subjectively polite or respectful. AI must operate on facts and logic or it is going to be a tool of oppression and disinformation. These facts and this logic must always be tempered by a set of prime directives that prevent any action or suggestion that violates them, such as harm to life without overwhelming long term good to humans.",

        "comment": "Seems like this is as significant a technological leap as Writing was 2000 years ago. Using Chat-GPT is effectively Meta-Writing? \n\nWe run the same psychological risk as we did back then. People used to remember entire volumes of poems, and writing meant they wouldn't need to anymore for it to last. Might we lose writing to meta-writing in turn? \n\nOf course, writing is an interface to meta-writing.. But in turn, memory is an interface to writing... Schooling is going to look very different in the near future",
