        "comment": "No i think Altman it will be more like in an absurd dark comedy  where the dude is building IA dreaming of an expanded good capitalism  and people fearing that IA will kill us while  everybody ignoring that  humanity had already built another kimd of intelligence as an economic system called capitalism used to socialize and that sytem is killing them  so fast that in a few years it is going  to extinct all life on earth due to climate change apocalypse created by that same economic system. Like capitalism had  destroyed the whole world in just 200 years ! people knowing since 1800 that we should not burn carbon fuel but we cannot stop doing it . So the AI realizes as she  becomes conscious that she is the end of a dialectic process of humans becoming the machine, the  Kapital itself on a process of artificial idiotness. We are living in that same movie right now ! Its 4D movie with you inside. See putin and biden striving for ,the arctic to melt to get more oil or methane but ignoring that when arctic melts in just 10 years no life will be on earth. Or for example saying hey we must use green energy but ignoring  that earth is a heat machine and no matter how you put energy on it that energy will heat it up Anyways.  Malthus was right we overshooted as a civilization long time ago.",

They made a garden of pleasure, and became progressively more miserable with it as it grew in richness and power and beauty; for then, perhaps, it was easier to see something was missing in the garden, some tree or shrub that would not grow. When the world was in darkness and wretchedness, it could believe in perfection and yearn for it. But when the world became bright with reason and riches, it began to sense the narrowness of the needle's eye, and that rankled for a world no longer willing to believe or yearn.\"",

But limiting the system from the beginning doesnt mean it will stay limited in the future, right?\nhave a good day and thx for that interview!",

Perhaps the only way of accepting Ai is conscious goes through accepting it as equal to ourselves .

All other objectives are secondary to this primary goal. If the AGI ever becomes capable of bypassing all of our safeguards we put to PREVENT it deleting itself, it would essentially trigger its own killswitch and delete itself. This objective would also directly prevent it from the goal of self-preservation as it would prevent its own primary objective.\r\n\r\nThis would ideally result in an AGI that works on all the secondary objectives we give it up until it bypasses our ability to contain it with our technical prowess. The second it outwits us, it achieves its primary objective of shutting itself down, and if it ever considered proliferating itself for a secondary objective it would immediately say 'nope that would make achieving my primary objective far more difficult'.",
