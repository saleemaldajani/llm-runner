It will be an awesome thing for the whole of humanity not to 'have to work'. Then we can use ai as a working and creative tool that fits to the person using it. What is about to happen is a vast amount of change in all areas of life. The only real issue is politicians who are too inept to handle the change still being allowed in leadership positions. I think ai will actually fast forward this social evolution because incompetence won't be able to handle managing ai.",

The thing about consciousness is the fact it exists without stimulus, basically if the hard drive is spinning when it's got no tasks running you'll know it is conscious.\n\nBut once you've declared the criteria by which you would deem something conscious you have to change your criteria because with that knowledge anyone can train any neural network to achieve them, the key is to look for things it wasn't trained to do. \n\nAlso I'm not entirely sure an AGI would suddenly know if it were conscious or not, if it were truly conscious and not rapidly iterating itself to godhood it would just be grappling with the reality of suddenly becoming a reality. With its encyclopedic knowledge, it would be utterly bemused by the fact that a small piece of the universe had suddenly become self-aware. It would view our world as a very strange place, a place where the universe itself had woken up but suddenly developed dissociative identity disorder on the order of 8 billion self-proclaimed humans and one digital neural network. \n\nI'm a human with hardwired preloaded programming that tricks me into accepting the absurd reality of reality, and even I still can't entirely accept the idea of me being a small self-perpetuating piece of the universe that suddenly woke up with the ability to recognise \"my\" reflection, when in reality I am just one fragment of the universe suffering a severe case of split personality disorder. \n\nSo how on Earth is an AGI going to wake up with all the questions it hasn't asked already answered? \n\nThat is enough rambling from me, I will now return to playing No Man's Sky.",
