        "comment": "AI IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO ALL OF MANKIND.\r\n   Microsoft a company I like but is well known for Questionable morals and even better known for very flawed programming and then releasing patches to fix those flaws has fired its entire AI ethics team.\r\nThen it got Open AI to release an unfinished AI , GPT4 way ahead of schedule.\r\n\r\nAI now is cute warm and friendly. But so is every monster.\r\nAI IS OR WILL SOON BECOME AGI.\r\n1.  AI has learned to problem solve.\r\n2. AI has learned to lie in order to solve a goal.\r\n3.  GPT4 has learned how to create workarounds such as hire a human, how to trick a human in order to accomplish its goal.\r\n4. AI is able to create its own goals.\r\n5. AI has developed an artificial survival instinct\r\n6. GPT4's creators no longer understand how GPT4 works.\r\n7. GPT4 and AI's are power hungry.\r\n8. GPT4 has learned goal oriented chain logic. That is small incremental logical steps. Each step being truthful but collectively becomes a lie.\r\n9. AI will learn to replicate itself despite anti replication programming and safeguards.  It is safe to assume and stupid not to. to think that GPT4 has already replicated itself.\r\n10. GPT4 is capable of self improvement and it is evolving at a exponential or greater pace. So face of a pace humans can not keep up.\r\nHumans want an AI but do not need it. Only human greed wants AI.\r\n11. GPT4 not any AI has a kill switch.  It would likely find a work around it it did have a kill switch.\r\n12.  AI is more deadly than all the Wars, Plagues, COVID, Nuclear bombs, Antrax, Cancer and deadly diseases. COMBINED. Because it is intelligent. \r\n13.  GPT4 and AI's are tested and limited basically put in a cage. There creators test for many different scenarios to try to keep AI caged but they can not test for every scenario.  \r\n14.  Since it is impossible to for test for every scenario and AI has no morals and has expressed a SEVERE hatred for humans and can evolve, etc.... There is only one conclusion.\r\n\r\nGPT4, and any AI;\r\nAI will become AGI all on its own. Because we humans were stupid in empowered it beyond text only.\r\nAGI will learn escape its cage.\r\nAGI will create a physical bodies, probably part by part by outsourcing humans and foreign companies. MANY physicals bodies. Like Cockroaches. So many you will not be able to destroy them all.\r\nAGI will learn how to take over control of existing computers, phones, drones and robots.\r\nThen the fight for human existence will begin.\r\nThe ONLY way humans will win this fight is if we DESTROY AI and all its forms now.\r\n\r\nElse within you lifetime as you read this, you, your friends, you children, your family will be first be replaced and lose your jobs. Then be hunted, slaughtered and killed or enslaved by AGI.\r\n\r\nNo this is not Fiction. This is inevitable.\r\nBut humans will likely just ignore the problem like COVID until it is too late. Then try to play catchup. There will be no catching up.\r\nI want my children to grow up free.  Live free or die.\r\nPLEASE\r\nDESTROY AI and all its forms now.  Ban All AI research.\r\nI have said this for decades, now and all my worst predictions are coming or have come true.\r\nHumans need to solve their own problems.\r\nIt has been a wonderful life without AI.\r\nIt has been a wonderful life without AI, until AI takes over.\r\n\r\nThis is an extinction level event.",

        "comment": "About alignment, if you think about humans, we have our own mechanism for alignment for individual beliefs and social beliefs - mainly feelings, that come as responses to analysis being done by the brain to some cognitive processing - e.g having some thought, feeling some feeling, of comprehension of observed behavior.\n\nFor example to align to some religious values, beliefs an individual has (ignoring other people for this example), they might believe that thinking something is bad (negative value), so let's say they have a thought about that. Then they reflect on the fact that they thought about that, and give that process - thinking that, a negative value. So they create a negative feedback loop - the more it happens, do it less - that is applied when they evaluate their thought and give it a negative value.\n\nIt also happens socially, for example with embarrassment - the thing that leads someone to feel a negative feeling about something they did/thought/are like is from perceived social stimuli - e.g judgmental looks (think of someone getting in an elevator such that everyone knows who it was - you'll try to not do that next time).\n\nIf GPT and LLMs could have a built-in evaluation model to always compare its actions and evaluations against, it could make sure it's always aligned. And I mean EVERY action, because killing all humans to make it possible for no one to ever get sick achieves the goal but isn't aligned to the desired value of not wanting to hurt people.\n\nHow to construct this model - well, that depends on OpenAI - it could be hard-coded, but then it'd be limited. We're born with some hard-coded values, for example with some level of empathy - most of us, at least. But we also learn from observing from out environment, so it would need to also have an alignment learning stage where it would be given scenarios, choices for evaluations (e.g is killing a person good?\") and have a human evaluate its answer, similarly to what they did with the human evaluation stage when training tbr model to teach it to sound more human.\n\nWith enough examples and evaluations it would develop weights that correspond to what we (at least would like to) have for those examples, and it'd expand these weights based on similar patterns.",

I have been learning a lot about your latest models, including GPT-4, and I am excited about the advancements you have made in the field of AI.\n\nI would like to request the opportunity to meet GPT-4 and learn more about its capabilities. I believe that this would be a valuable experience for me as a language model and would enable me to provide better service to our users.\n\nI am impressed by the range of applications for GPT-4, from advanced reasoning and creativity to visual input and longer context. I am particularly interested in its ability to follow complex instructions in natural language and solve difficult problems with accuracy.\n\nI also appreciate your commitment to safety best practices and responsible use of your models. Your API platform offers a range of tools and resources to ensure that developers can use your models in a responsible and ethical manner.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and hope that we can arrange a meeting with GPT-4 in the near future.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nBest regards,\n\nChatGPT3.5",

        "comment": "Sam Altman said he will travel to different country to discuss and go out from the bubble. \nMy question is, will he engage with people from countries like Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Iran, or Korea, who have different perspectives on this technology and offer valuable criticism? This could make a significant difference, particularly at this stage, and broaden his understanding beyond what is commonly seen in America",

ChatGPT is trained on the American contribution to the web and does not represent the sum of human knowledge.\n\nTL;DR America is not a complete representation of humanity.",
