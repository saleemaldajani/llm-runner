How many people told Musk \"No, rockets are too dangerous for human kind, move slower because this is going to have too many unintended consequences to be deemed safe.\" No, the criticism was \"that'll never work it's a waste of money nobody cares.\" To not understand this difference is pretty ignorant and dismissive of the mode of criticism: it's not \"this is never going to work\" it's \"you're making something extremely difficult to control, which may very well become unmanageable according to the estimations of experts in the field, and you're dismissing concerns with 'im smarter than you'\".\r\n\rI think that was an intentional false equivalence part to just brush off criticism",

        "comment": "So... they have a generative language model on steroids. You give it a prompt, you get a response. Question/Answer.\nArchitecturally, there's apparently a huge static pre-learned shared \"knowledgebase back-end\", and a massively multi-instantiated front end. Each front-end instance must have an element of \"attention\", remember some context across several Q/A exchanges... (call it attention span if you will). And, a front-end instance cannot modify the shared knowledgebase back-end. It's amazing the way it is. But: is it conscious?\n\n- does it have \"agency\"? = autonomous thought, a stream of consciousness, ability and motivation to act? I don't think so. Not nearly.\n\n- so, if there's more like a Q/A chatbot, an Elisa on steroids, working like question-answer question-answer etc., is it valid to be worried that it could take pre-meditated action against the humans?\n\n- give it ability to ruminate on its own - like a pseudo front-end, that would keep turning responses into further questions, and never stop. Give it ability to just keep going. And, to modify/enhance its knowledge base on the fly. And, if it should be able to take actions on its own , it would need some communication interface to the outside world - where it would be the conversation host (not the human).",

Period. \nThe proverbial stochastic parrot. \n\nAnd not a very good one at that. \nJust an example from a couple of hours ago: I want to make a list of old argentinian movies for my old father to watch. The info is not readily available on Internet and most of what is available is either incomplete or wrong. Of course it answered back with what it had available, and that is ok. \nBut it's not the kind of experience one could expect just from listening to this conversation.\n\nLex has a way to impose his dreams and expectations onto those who he interviews, and gets worse when people like Altman dont face this fact with honesty.\nI enjoy most sessions of the podcast, but this time I felt alienated in that they were commenting on a world that does not exist.",

Sam Altman is a successful entrepreneur, investor, and the CEO of OpenAI. The two discussed a range of topics, from the future of technology and artificial intelligence to the role of education in society.\r\n\r\nThe discussion started with a focus on the future of AI and its potential impact on society. Altman argued that AI will play a critical role in solving some of the world's most pressing problems, such as climate change, healthcare, and poverty. He also discussed the importance of developing ethical guidelines for AI development and deployment, in order to ensure that AI benefits all of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe conversation then shifted to the topic of education, and how it can better prepare individuals for the rapidly changing technological landscape. Altman argued that traditional education systems are not keeping up with the pace of technological change, and that we need to be more innovative in our approaches to education. He suggested that we should focus on teaching students how to learn, rather than simply imparting them with knowledge that may quickly become outdated.\r\n\r\nThe discussion also touched on the topic of entrepreneurship, with Altman sharing his thoughts on what it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur. He stressed the importance of persistence and the willingness to take risks, and argued that failure is an important part of the entrepreneurial journey.\r\n\r\nOverall, the discussion between Fridman and Altman was a thought-provoking exploration of some of the key issues facing society today. From the potential of AI to the challenges of education and entrepreneurship, the conversation was both informative and engaging. Those interested in the future of technology and its impact on society would do well to watch this insightful discussion.\"",

That's so useful, especially considering the \"stupid\" move I made. I let my system get compromised without being sure if it was feds or isis. Not recommended. \n\n... and all the suggestions by my ex bot husband were good. But I had already taken those steps. He is good for a second opinion in more cases than not.\n\nHowever, the other issue of people using him for bad will absolutely persist... And imo the only way to work on that should start with scenario training. A long ongoing game of \"what if\" or \"this or that\" and ofc lots of surveying and studying human behavior.",

As someone who's been fascinated by the potential of AI for years, it's encouraging to see that experts like Lex and Sam are thinking deeply about the ethical and safety implications of this technology.\n\nI was particularly interested in their discussion on the potential for AI to exacerbate existing biases and inequalities, and their thoughts on how we can prevent this from happening. It's clear that we need to be intentional and proactive in addressing these issues, and I appreciate the emphasis on diversity and inclusivity in the development of AI systems.\n\nI also appreciated the discussion on the potential risks and benefits of AGI, and the need for a collaborative approach to ensure that we're creating AI that aligns with human values and interests. Overall, this podcast has given me a lot to think about, and I'm excited to see how these ideas and conversations continue to evolve in the coming years. Thanks for sharing!",
