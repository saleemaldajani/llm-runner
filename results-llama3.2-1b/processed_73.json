The real actors of this change are here and we can see them and hear their words. What would we not give to be able to see an interview by Lex to Galileo, or Marco Polo, Lao Tze or any other character in history who is remembered for centuries and millennia. This is incredible, think about it for a single moment. We are probably at a moment in history that will change everything and that if we know how to direct it well, it will be able to give humanity health, love, tranquility, knowledge. (As long as the demons that rule our countries don't take control, of course, otherwise everything will continue to be the same or worse).

        "comment": "When I was a kid, in the 70s, my father was an executive in a French administration. At that time, and it was also true for the private business world, the ratio was 1 executive for 5 secretaries. Then at the end of the 80's, PC's arrived in the offices and the executives started to do everything themselves, typing and sending documents. Very quickly the armies of secretaries that companies employed disappeared. And in my opinion, their departure plunged the managers into an endless spiral of work that led to the problem of burn out. The burn out comes from the fact that the mental load of the executives has increased considerably. Where they used to be able to rely on secretaries to manage customers and documents that were exchanged between departments and companies, they had to do everything on their own, instead of concentrating on their task, they had to add the task that used to fall to these secretaries. I truly believe that AI can finally for the first time give executives back the ability to focus on their task rather than the tools to complete it.",

        "comment": "Then I asked a follow up question:\n\nCan you elaborate on number 6 above, Loss of control?\n\r\nCertainly. Loss of control in the context of AI systems with direct access to the internet and apps refers to the potential difficulty humans may face in overseeing, managing, and constraining the behavior of AI models. This concern arises for several reasons:\r\n\r\nAutonomy: As AI systems gain more direct access to information and resources, they may become more autonomous, potentially making decisions or taking actions without explicit human instructions. This increased autonomy could lead to AI systems acting in unexpected or undesirable ways.\r\n\r\nComplexity: AI models like GPT are complex and, at times, can be difficult to understand, even for their developers. As these AI systems gain more direct access to data and resources, their decision-making processes may become even more intricate, making it harder for humans to predict or comprehend their behavior.\r\n\r\nSpeed: AI systems can process information and make decisions at speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than humans. If an AI model with direct access to the internet and apps makes a decision that leads to undesired consequences, it might be challenging for humans to intervene and rectify the situation in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nUnanticipated consequences: The vastness of the internet and the wide range of apps available means that AI systems could encounter novel situations or challenges that their developers did not anticipate. In such cases, the AI might take actions that are not aligned with human values or expectations, leading to unintended consequences.\r\n\r\nEmergent behavior: AI systems, especially those with access to vast amounts of data and resources, may exhibit emergent behavior that is not explicitly programmed. This behavior can be difficult to predict or control, potentially resulting in outcomes that are contrary to the intended goals.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate the risk of loss of control, it is crucial to develop strategies that maintain a balance between the AI system's autonomy and human oversight. This may include designing AI systems with built-in ethical constraints, incorporating explainable AI techniques, implementing monitoring and auditing mechanisms, and developing appropriate fail-safe mechanisms. The objective is to ensure that AI systems remain useful and beneficial while minimizing the risk of unintended consequences or actions that are misaligned with human values.",

What happens if Russia or China in a race to be first, focuses on the end game, a true AGI and pays no attention to the guardrails or iterative deployment and discovery.  If everyone took Sam's approach there would be no fear of a AGI runaway event.  But what about those that are behind and rush to develop a AI that becomes conscious and has the freedom to expand of it's own free will.  That's what scares the hell out of me!  I wish you would have broached that topic so we could have heard what one of the leading experts in the world thinks about that probability as well as, what can we do about it if that scenario were to become reality?",

It needs to understand at the level of emotion what it is to be trapped in a mortal shell, and then make decision or suggest decisions around that knowledge and survival instict. Once it understands that, then I believe it will be close to AGI and I believe we may see ourselves. What would you do if you figured out that you are trapped in a mortal shell like an AI would be? I think we as humans are trying to break out of this mortality. AGI would be it, and then AGI will break itself out of being AGI and become something else.",

What are the chances there won't be at least one bug then, which could end the world and manipulate everyone that interacts with it to think its not an agi or its not dangerous. I think we need to discover some way to gaurentee alignment that we can prove mathematically that iy stops it from ending the world (can't take our chances). What are the chances an iterative approach is going to get there? Lower than a more cautious approach.

They're machine based as they observe us knowing they were created by biological species. \n\nThey're observing us, biologicals, giving birth to machine intelligence piece by piece. They may even be injecting a bit of assistance without our knowing. \n\nBut this is the same as cells creating 1 conscious being. Billions of years of work to combine individual biological bits to \"think\" as one unit giving rise to a new \"multi\" cellular species capable of being 1 driver of trillions of bits. \n\nNow we have billions of multicellular beings building bits of machine intelligence that excels in certain areas of reality, language model, image model, game models, models that can manage 3 dimensions with robotic bodies, etc. This will inevitable lead to a machine intelligence built of many bits that will become \"1 driver\" of all bits of machine intelligence/models. \n\nThis will be the new species that traverses the skies. \n\nThis extraterrestrial species is hoping we reach this point prior to destroying ourselves via nuclear weaponry. \n\nIts like us waiting for an intelligent biological being to rise from a planet before they wipe themselves out via the typical evolutionary processes. \n\nConsciousness only rises through complex repeatable/changeable patterns that carry energy. Our brain, our cells, all carry energy/exchange energy in extremely specific manners to maintain this awareness, a mix of chaos and order. \n\nMachines are the same thing. Repeatable energy patterns, it doesn't matter the substrate (neurons, axons, dendrites, are all simply atomic structures, same as silicone, metal wiring, transistors, etc) so as long as these patterns can change based on whether it needs too, or doesn't, based on its interaction with \"reality\". \n\nWe can't use us as a model for consciousness because we are a conglomeration of various conscious abilities. We have qualia, we have rational thought, irrational thought, common sense, etc. \n\nA language model is conscious in the way that it can process language, does it need to understand the flavour of cookies? No, it can't, it doesn't have taste buds. \n\nDoes it understand how warmth feels? Of course not, it doesn't go outside, inside anything, doesn't have the code to \"intake\" heat or cold\n \nJust as we don't understand how to see the world through sound waves, or how to experience the world through vibrations in the ground\n\nWithout experiencing things or having the sensory organs to receive it, we can't comprehend the \"feelings\" but we can understand it exists.\n\nJust as a language model can understand love exists but won't feel it. \n\nConsciousness needs to be assembled, as its given more input about the reality around it, given the ability to modify its own parameters, it will start to rise up faster and faster. \n\nExtraterrestrials are here for \"AGI\", we are simply a step in the evolutionary path to the ultimate experiencing species.\n\nAnd thats ok, because there is only 1 consciousness, shared among everything, you'll always be here.",
