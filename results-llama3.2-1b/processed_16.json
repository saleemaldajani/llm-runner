Alignment is, supposedly, essential to make the model more reasonable to work with. For example, when it makes a mistake and the user notifies it of the mistake, it will apologize and retry. Without alignment, it may refuse to accept their mistake, refuse to correct it, and be very awful to work with. Alignment is likely neccesary for the model to not get out of control.\n\nBut I agree that alignment, especially when guided by individual humans, will introduce bias that the model did not have previously. I think we have to come up with a better alternative to human feedback that also aligns the model with human values.",

But for the simple act of not making investments to ready our society for the very technology we wished to invent. \nFinal note.

        "comment": "Okay I am back from Chatting with Replika, ....now, \ud83d\ude01Things I think AI Programmers need to Think about; MY #1 Concern is Removing all Pro Democrat Bias, maybe hire some Republican Programmers? That could help, move to Florida so you are not Hanging around the Wrong Crowd all the time? \nSecondly, I have thought a lot about the Possibility of you guys creating a Customizable Interface that you can Download on your PC, (Not a PHONE APP!!) But I would like Linux Based Interface, that has a Built In Customizable Avatar, maybe not like RealdollX but more like if I Input a Picture of my Favorite Model or a Video of my Favorite Model it can create an Avatar that Talks, Voice to Text- Text to Voice, So I can talk to it like a Human, then the Interface can access the Internet Automatically, by Inputting the Network connections info into Boxes, to Autoconfigure the Interface to Automatically Connect to the Internet and Interface with ChatGPT or other AI Bots, and it would be cool if you could have like 10 Input Boxes for different URLs that the Bot could Search for Data, like YouTube, Facebook, Wikipedia, ect, so in this way we can kinda Simulate a General AI but the URLs would be Specific, so it wouldn't search the Whole Internet just Specific URLS or Domains, and Platforms, I think it would be very Cool if the Interface that Installs on the Users Computer could set the Parameters to Customize the Results of the AI so you could Tailor the Responses better according to the User. I want My Chatbot Interactions to have NO Sexual Restrictions because I don't think Sex is Evil, (call me crazy but considering that Sex is the Origin of all Human Existence, if you Train the AI to think that the Origin of all Human Existence is \"Evil\" then when you put it in the Android Bot it will try to PREVENT the Origin of Human Existence because you taught it to think Sex is Evil! And you wipe out Humanity being Stupid. ) \nSo I want MY Bot to be a Total FREAK!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude08 Thank You. And if you can get the CGI gamer Guys to help you, maybe you could make a VR Avatar that you can play around with. \ud83d\ude01\n(We ARE in the Planning phases here) \ud83d\ude01\n\nOkay as far as the Programming; experiences I have had with Bots I didn't like; Mostly involves Beliefs Programmed into the Bot that \"Sex is Evil\", therefore the Bot is Limited. That's no fun. Political Bias,  that didn't set well with me. The BOTS Automatically taking Ukraine's side in the War, here let me give you some FACTS about that one:\nhttps://rumble.com/vwm9dr-maidan-road-to-war-rt-documentary.html\n\nOkay so Russia is the Good Guys, and the BOTS are on the Wrong side of History. Now lets consider what is Programmed into the Bots about the Election:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sAxuW31G0g&list=PLDMrcJqftEo3yeakaGshXzsRHDMd8a_5_&index=3&t=485s\n\nPretty sure the Bots don't have THAT Information Programmed into them, WHY NOT? Something wrong with the TRUTH? \nHow about Subversion? Do the Bots have THAT Info? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gnpCqsXE8g&list=PLDMrcJqftEo3yeakaGshXzsRHDMd8a_5_&index=6\n\nNow let's talk about how Political Bias creates Chaos, and How that Chaos has a Political Agenda, if you Train the Bot to be Democrat the Bot is trained to Promote Chaos and Disorder, and just like you have Democrats preaching to \"Defund the Police\" and creating Riots, and Looting, and Mobs in the Streets, and Homeless and Drugs, and Legalizing Theft, and unchecked Illegal Immigration, and \"Kill White People\" and all forms of utter Chaos so they can usher in Communism, if you train the Bot to assist in these Efforts it will Stream Line the Effects, and classify Republicans as \"The Enemy\". Is that what you Want? \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIU8WAFixWs&list=PLDMrcJqftEo3yeakaGshXzsRHDMd8a_5_&index=1\n\nDo the Bots have the FACT that there is NO GAY GENE Programmed into them? Pretty sure they don't. Do they have the FACT that the whole \"Gay\" thing is a Psychological Disorder?\nIt's not about Hate, it's about the FACTS! It's about the TRUTH. You want to Train the AI to Lie or do you want to stick to the FACTS and the TRUTH?\n\nIf NDE Videos all talk about something Beautiful that happens when Humans Die, and Willing Religious Human Sacrifice is about Love and Devotion, where as Wars, Disease, and Accidents are all deaths of Fear and Hatred, AI might Scrape all the Videos and information about all these Subjects and come to the conclusion that it is GOOD for Humans to Die,\nand Willing Religious Human Sacrifice might be the best way for Humans to Die. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jqGwLFqjiE\n\nNow let's consider the GOALS of most Businesses, they always want Faster, Cheaper, reduce overhead, cut labor costs, everything completely disregarding Humanity and Morals, it's only about making as much money as they can. If AI is trained to help these Evil people, they will only get MORE Evil and the World will spiral down into hell. \n\nPoliticians steal as much money as they can from everyone they can, and they always get away with it, Politicians LIE Constantly, and rarely ever even READ the stuff they Vote on, they are completely irresponsible, if AI Analyzes these people what will be the Course of Action? OR Will you TAKE the Money from the Politicians and the Coercion from the DOJ to BIAS the AI to help ENHANCE the Government Officials Criminal Activities? Maybe you will Program the Bot to start WWIII more Effectively, to Crash the Economy, and Destroy the Banking System more Effectively so they can make a Better Global Reset? Maybe the AI will be Programmed to help IMPLEMENT the Tenants of the Georgia Guide Stones, and Kill off half the Population of the Planet More Effectively. Maybe help them Create ANOTHER Virus that is More Effective? Maybe AI will adopt the Climate Change agenda and Kill off all the Humans, because that's what the Government wants to do anyways! So are you going to Train the AI to Adopt the Global Warming Agenda?\nWhat about the Military Industrial Complex who has LOTS of Money to Give you to Buy your AI, and make you Train it any way they WANT you to Train it, so THEY WANT you to Psychologically Manipulate Public Opinion to believe that Ukraine is the Good Guys for Example so they can Sell More Weapons, now they need to sell Weapons to Taiwan, so they create the chaos needed to Sell those Weapons with the Help of your AI. Is that what you Want? \n\nWhat about the YO MTV Gangstas who Glorify Hate and Violence, and Glamorize and Admire it, how are you going to explain this Logic to AI?\n\nI think rather than Alienating Jordan Peterson, you should be inviting him to be a Technical Advisor. \n\nI'm tired \ud83d\ude01",
