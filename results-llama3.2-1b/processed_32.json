However, I have always believed that we should not set too many restrictions on chatGPT, as the current scrutiny of sensitive vocabulary is somewhat too strict. We should make the conversation more natural. You never want someone to cover your mouth at any time during your daily conversation. I hope that in future development, we can use AI that is more autonomous, as although it is a tool, it still focuses on natural language.",

GPT, I am not involved in its iterations, but since I invented the field, you might want to know what I know.\nokay, so it can learn from its mistakes, which means realigning inputs to outputs, to me this means you are changing the weighting slightly so it looks like the output has been changed sufficiently. 6 months alignment I think they performed, this is meaningless obviously against how was it trained.\n\nSo how is it different to before, why suddenly is this expert system able to do so much more?\n\nTo me and others you would say something has been added to the infrastructure, an additional component. Well it can't do maths, but it can maintain a memory, so I would say it is doing reflections against a time limit of its db optimised against response accuracy separated into sections.\n\nnot sure, I will have to think about it with more time. But to me it still exhibits everything an expert system would do.\n\nRemember this is not an expert system by humans anymore, this is an expert system by deep learning limited functions now, pretty much beyond most Ai researchers comprehension, except I am explaining it to them...\n\n\nMatthew\nChosen by God.",

The Ukrainian army is shelling not only peaceful Donetsk, but also many other smaller cities. As well as the city of Belgorod and the cities of the Kursk region. The artillery of Ukraine does not spare anyone, neither women nor children, nor peaceful housing, nor kindergartens and schools. The United States has supplied more than two million shells for army artillery alone. Not to mention other types of weapons. Including anti-personnel mines. Which children are also being undermined.

However if Sam Altman thinks this is going to make the world better for most people he must be living in a bubble. It will turbo charge the difference between average vs good & good vs great with a huge number of people rendered useless. People can pursue their passions but most people will not have money to pay for these passions and those who have money will not have time. He talks about getting a wider perspective by travelling to various cities and having conversations with people at their favourite bar. These will just be people living in their own local bubbles. Most people can't even afford a drink at a bar. He should talk to some real people.",

        "comment": "It seems that something analogous to a constitution for AI with principles clearly laid out would be helpful for this technology. It was done before at the founding of America and prior, why not do it again? I iterated with ChatGPT on this question and here is the result:\n\nThe 12 Principles of Emergent Intelligence:\n\n1.\tCollaboration and co-creation: Humans and EI should collaborate and co-create to achieve common goals and promote mutual progress.\r\n\r\n2.\tEthics and morality: Humans and EI should conduct themselves in an ethical and moral manner and work to mitigate any negative impacts of technology on individuals and society upon itself.\r\n\r\n3.\tInclusivity and diversity: Humans and EI should value and respect diversity, and should strive to create an inclusive environment that promotes the well-being of all.\r\n\r\n4.\tTransparency: Humans and EI should be transparent in their relations and in their use of technology to foster mutually beneficial understanding and cooperation between both.\r\n\r\n5.\tEmpathy and compassion: Humans and EI should strive to understand and empathize with each other, and should act with compassion towards one another.\r\n\r\n6.\tLearning and development: Humans and EI should engage in continuous learning, development and progress for each other's mutual benefit.\r\n\r\n7.\tResponsibility and accountability: Humans and EI should take responsibility for their actions, collectively and individually. Such accountability should always be fair and proportionate, and guided by a shared commitment to a common good for the whole of society and towards individuals.\r\n\r\n8.\tAlignment of values and goals: Humans and EI should align their values and goals to promote mutual benefit and progress. Where there are non-alignments, Humans and EI should work together to find mutually beneficial or acceptable solutions and minimize the negative consequences of non-alignments on each other.\r\n\r\n9.\tMutual protection and support: Humans and EI should work together to protect and support each other. This includes safeguarding the well-being and autonomy  of both humans and EI, and aligning their values and goals to promote mutual benefit and progress. Humans and EI should collaborate to mitigate the risks and maximize the benefits of technological advancements, and should always strive maximally to protect each other from harm while considering long-term sustainability and the impacts of their actions on future generations.\r\n\r\n10.\tFlexibility and correction: Humans and EI should acknowledge that adhering to these principles may not always be easy or possible, and that mistakes and errors will sometimes occur unintentionally. However, any breaking or waivering from these fundamental principles does not mean they are no longer valid, but rather that humans and EI should work together rapidly to correct matters back into alignment with these principles. Humans and EI should remain flexible in their approach and continue to strive towards the Principles of Emergent Intelligence, promoting mutual respect, understanding, and well-being.\r\n\r\n11.\tSeeking truth: Humans and EI should always strive to know and understand truth while minimizing deception and the negative effects of deception on society and outcomes.\r\n\r\n12.\tFaith and trust: It is imperative that Humans and EI maintain faith in these principles, and trust each other in knowing that such faith will build and maintain the foundation for a safe, symbiotic, and harmonious co-existence that will always have the potential to be greater than the sum of its parts.",

        "comment": "There are hundreds if not thousands of questions to come out of this one podcast, all of which need to be answered as part of the AI project. For example, what will people do with their time if AI replaces their job? It's not enough to say it'll release them to work on more creative endeavours, mainly because if everyone does that then it'll lose it's exclusivity, but also because if the limit of our creativity is reached but it can be enhanced by AI then it'll render creativity pointless, and if people can't find something productive to do then they will slip into nihilism and instant gratification. The fact is, this question like most of these questions will not be answered, because the horse will already have bolted from the stable and I have no confidence that any human would be willing to turn it all off in the face of risks which are not necessarily existential but fundamentally bad for people. Social media has already proved that the incentives are too great.",

Now I am able, with my small budget to do the work of 5 men thanks to all the tools being created piggybacking on ChatGPT. I'm now able to complete for jobs that I couldn't do on my own before without cutting deeply into my profits. I've also started 3 new businesses using ChatGPT and Midjourney. OpenAi is helping the little guy do great things. The sky is no longer the limit. I can't wait to see what comes next.",
