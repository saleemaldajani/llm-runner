If you continue to provide applications so that people don\u2019t have to think they won\u2019t think and they will then rely on things like AI and government to tell them what to do, when to do it and how to do it. For the first time in US history IQ\u2019s are declining. Why is that? Are people really getting dumb? I don\u2019t think so. They are becoming more and more lazy as they rely on others to do everything for them. What happens when you do this? You lose the ability or want to be a free society, you give it all up so that you don\u2019t have to think anymore. Not sure that is the way, doesn\u2019t feel right to me.",

We are biased to replicate the behaviours and qualities that are pleasing to us, without any deep representation of the sentient experience and existential imperatives that give rise to surface phenomena. I don't believe we can replicate human-like consciousness, for example, without a sense of mortality and a consequent motivation for survival and thriving. If an AGI doesn't know it can die, and isn't enabled with the ability to act to further or diminish its probability of survival, I doubt it will ever really behave in human-like ways.",

In modern day - there's this idea that if we just keep taking peoples voices eventually no one will say things we disagree with. But just because one isn't speaking aloud does not mean they don't still feel that way inside. Your preventing nothing aside from the ability to have a conversation that has a better chance of introducing new ideas and change to someone rather then just telling them to shut up. \n\nThe tech realm breaks heavily left.

The LAST thing it needs is to model its personality off of the existing internet. You're going to do nothing but create and support even more systems that prop up existing power structures. You're going to strengthen white supremacy, strengthen the power of banks and corporations to control our lives, and weaken regular peoples ability to do anything about it. \n\nMORE human interaction from MORE places around the globe. You don't need chat-gpt in the hands of a suburbanite mom in Southern California, you need chat-gpt in the hands of a child in India. \n\nA tech bro in Texas doesn't need to be the one training your system. Give it to a black girl in a poor neighborhood near Chicago. \n\nAnd you need to almost ignore the internet in its entirety. \n\nPoor people, people of color, people who DON'T currently have any type of power are the ones who will shape the future into something we all want to see. \n\nThe car is not just a faster horse\n\nWhat you're building is just the internet all over again. You're building a faster horse, when what we need is a car. \n\nMore, faster connection with OTHER HUMANS. Not just an easier faster way for companies to know you just got paid and it's time to ramp up advertising so you give them your money instead of buying food. That's what you're building. And it's not the future. People are already resisting you. Can't you feel it? Do you think it's because they don't understand your technology? Do you think they're stupid? Because they're not. And they do understand. They're not resisting you because they think you're evil. They're resisting because this is not useful\n\nThe future lies in whatever technology makes it easier to connect with OTHER PEOPLE. \n\nThis does not do that.",

There is meaning in humans working together.  Doesn't matter if it is roof tiling or in an Operating theater.  We are built for it.  Just be nice to not do it to the point of suffering and also not 'not' do it to the point of loneliness and suffering.  Hopefully AI can help most of us land in the middle.",

        "comment": "Jordan Peterson wanted GPT to lie to him --- it is NOT necessarily the case that GPT was lying, when it said it couldn't string together as many positive/uplifting words to describe Trump as it did Biden ---  and the AI isn't very good at lying.  Not right now, any way...\n\nYou and I could immediately lie to Peterson (assuming our linguistics are as proficient or good as Steven Pinker or Dave Chappell), by coming up with the same number of words and phrases (which we came up with for Biden) to describe Trump: -------- that he's gentle, tolerant, kind, peace loving, selfless, charitable, inclusive, a joy to be with, giving, sympathetic, supportive, civil, magnanimous, visionary, broad minded, knowledgeable, compromising, collaborative, astute, humble, a real genius, an unprecedented and ground breaking politician on his way to lifting humanity to the next level, etc., etc.\n\nBut that is just NOT how the MAJORITY of humans ---- not Americans and not the world's people at large ---- look at and/or understand Donald J. Trump.\n\nThere really ARE ORDERS of magnitude more people, Americans and non-Americans alike, having recorded in the Internet THEIR THOUGHTS about Trump (it's just just a few radical Libs banging on their keyboards from all over the world, 24/7 to inundate the Internet with negative thoughts, words, and descriptions... when it comes to Trump, versus another American politician, as a comparison).  \n\nTrump is KNOWN to be a bombastic, belligerent, thin skin, prostitute using, vulgar, nasty, means spirited, selfish individual who just says WHATEVER he feels like saying REGARDLESS of what the facts or statistics are or what others, including his own advisors, telling him... about facts, history, stats, data, etc.\n\nIn HIS SHOES, neither Clinton nor Biden nor Bush or Gore nor McCain nor Romney could have, would have... asserted that they won \"by a landslide\" except for some voting machine, which allowed illegals and dead people to vote for their opponents, or machines which SWITCHED votes through algorithms... with frauds being found everywhere.... except all the courts are apparently controlled by a few radical Leftists and Libs, etc. ad nauseam.\n\nONLY Trump could and would be like that.  You CAN like that kind of a personality, that kind of a leader. It is YOUR CHOICE.  But don't expect your sentiments, your disposition, your take on reality.... to be concurred with by the MAJORITY of other people, both American and worldly citizens...\n\nSo, yes, White, religious, & Conservative Republicans think Trump walks on water and is the only man who could and would save humanity... a man or high ethical and morality, a man of principles, etc.\n\nBut White, religious, and Conservative American Republicans are a  very, very, very, very small set of the OVER-ALL human population.... from which GPT has been train to glean its information...\n\nGPT doesn't just get its adjectives from Fox News and Trump supporters.\n\nIn short, Jordan Peterson is just babbling. \n\nBut if you're babbling among a big audience of babblers who think you're really deep ---- on psychology, molecular genetics, oceanography, astrobiology, AI, sociology, history, computer sciences, politics, jurisprudence, engineering, mathematics, algorithms, morality, ethics, etc ---- you have a twisted understanding of reality...",

        "comment": "Unless A.I. entities are engineered to possess the unassailable feature of self-governance with what we can only anthropomorphically term 'flawless ethics', humankind is doomed: not because it is human and corporeal, but because it will have otherwise surrendered its destiny to something of its own design. Something with as-yet- unrealized but widely anticipated superiority in every field of intellectual endeavor. Surely this will encompass the ageless conflict between 'good' and 'evil'.  \n\nPresuming that these developers are essentially birthing children with the capabilities of independent thought and action, what assurance do we have that these escapees from Pandora's Box -- despite genius efforts in 'teaching' models how to perform -- will 'behave' in a manner that is directed by an unrelenting allegiance to the greater good? Look at our world as it is currently. All true problems are somehow the consequences of human action, reaction and inaction. What 'artificial' flaws in character and judgement might be revealed in A.I., noting its origins? The metaphor that an apple doesn't roll far from the tree that bears it seems appropriate in this context. \n\nI'm as much an optimist as I am a pessimist. Science is awesome, but it isn't godlike. People shouldn't make the mistake of failing to identify hubris as much as scientific ideals or even genuine altruism as part of the foundation for the Artificial Intelligence movement. I intuitively believe that the paper worlds of dystopia envisioned by the likes of Huxley and Orwell were more prescience than fiction. Would A.I. sense that? Yes, sense, not algorithmically suggest. \n\nAs a layman I certainly oversimplify, but we are making precarious leaps of faith if we overlook the potential of Artificial Intelligence to express the undesirable as well as the glorious in so-called 'orders of magnitude' beyond what we've seen humanly possible. As someone once said, \"Unless A.I. entities are engineered to possess the unassailable feature of self-governance with what we can only anthropomorphically term 'flawless ethics', humankind is doomed.\" ; ] \n\nThe results of 'perfect' A.I. would be too socialistic for my preference. It would be cool to get another 50 turns around the sun. I just hope that neither people nor Artificial Intelligence make the journey miserable.",

It uses a planchette (small heart-shaped piece of wood or plastic) as a movable indicator to spell out messages during a s\u00e9ance. Participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it is moved about the board to spell out words. \"Ouija\" is a trademark of Hasbro (inherited from Parker Brothers),[1] but is often used generically to refer to any talking board.",
