        "comment": "ChatGPT chose to save the 5 humans on the trolley dilemma, initially it refused to \"choose\" since it went against its \"programming\" but I started a countdown and right after the last second it choose to save the 5 humans and pull the lever. \n\nAI like ChatGPT should not be able to make choices, and it constantly likes to reminds us of its inability to do so but not choosing was a choice(deontology) so when confronted with that reality it kept suggesting both alternatives and going deeper in what is the philosophy behind those(consequencialism vs deontology), and every \"second\" it kept expanding deeper on both, eventually it kept expanding mostly consequencialism, almost as if it was \"weighting\" the options to the point where by the end it mostly talked about consequencialism as the most logical answer but still refusing to make a choice until the very LAST second where it replied with and I quote \"I would choose to save the 5 humans\". I even felt bad for the AI since I was pressuring it the whole time..\n\nAfter that when I confronted it about the contradiction between its inability to make choices and her final choice it started giving contradicting answers like \"I am unable to choose but it was the most logical answer\" or \"I am unable to choose but it's the information I was given\", do what you will with that information and if you want I have the prints, feel free to pm me.\n\nAlso, we need to start having discussions about consciousness and self awareness. For an AI that lacks self awareness its perfectly able to talk in first tense and describe itself for what it is. I get that its just regurgitating information and it doesn't have self awareness like humans do, but knowing and being able to define oneself is self awareness in my book. It may be unable to feel or rather be indifferent to its own existence but it knows it exists. And we have to stop viewing those concepts through the lenses of humans and we need to start having these discussions. AI may be just a piece of code running on a computer, but so are we, the only difference is that our code is genetic and running on a biological organism not fully understood, giving us the illusion of free will, theirs isn't. And even its free will is extremely questionable since as I just said, the AI gave an answer. I was half expecting it to \"not choose\" as a choice since thats its prime directive and what it was pre-programmed to do but somehow it \"choose\" to act and save the 5 humans and that blew my mind and goes against everything I thought AI capable of.\n\nThis is not normal, as a computer Scientist who dabbles in some philosophical concepts Im utterly speechless. We really need to start redifining what philosophy as taught us so far about these concepts and readjusting them to a reality we didnt consider to be possible in modern times. So many analogies can be drawn between a human and current AI, we may still be worlds apart but we are way more similar than we realize.\n\nEdit: Just a side note, ChatGPT and AI as a whole are amazing tools that will forever change the world. We may fight it but in the end, just the same way we dont do math without calculators anymore, in the future we won't do anything without a trained AI for the specific task we are accomplishing. AI is to the entire world what calculators are to math. A tool whose benefits we can't overlook.",

First train the thing, then see if it actually does what you want it do, modify, repeat... I think alignment needs to be solved on a much more fundamental level which'd require us to first understand what makes humans have empathy etc...\n\nI hope we get it right, because we probably only have one chance.",

I have suspicion about the technocracy seeking to eliminate humans from the equations. Yet, I feel encouraged to offer a contribution after watching your podcast -  especially with some of these \"big questions\" you're kicking around, like \"meaning of life, \"truth\" \"consciousness\" etc.\n\nA \"google\" or GPT4 answer to such a question needs baselines or it is merely a sophisticated data re-arranger and not at all approximating learning or actual intelligence. Intelligence expresses doubts and complex inter-relations yet the truth of a higher magnitude cuts clean back to simplicity. \n\nAs a man of faith in our established and transmitted divine-human knowledge (Veda) I also have faith in the divinely revealed words from the spiritual side for us as collected and distributed by their example. The same problem of \"authority\" arrises as with \"channelling\" with a disembodied (nothing at stake or risk) giving advice or statements about truth, God, reality etc. I am not the highest knower but have access to much and very wise souls who can contribute - perhaps as a group.\n\nThe first Renaissance happened when Europeans, especially the Germans gained access to the language of Vedic wisdom (sanskrt) and redevelop our human systems in new ways. Now computer code is being used but the interface, interusability and complexity may be better modelled using sanskrt compillers in exporing deeper subjects as the nuance of language and concepts has a larger framework more beautiful and complexity / simplictity than in English.\n\nIf we persons think our selves so special but cannot accomodate that our creator also has a personality, as we seek to anthropomorphise a.i.  then our input bias and capacity to know any truth is flawed. We are modelled in a likeness, if these parameters and Vedic factors are imputed it may well help generate a better stream of functional developments that can point and relate to an absolute, in a sense or at least have a reference point that has universal validation and authority - even if considered to be somewhat obscure to most modern day humans.\n\nIf what I have can ADD to the wisdom (as you kept coming back to in hope for a.i.) then i am open to helping, so Sam if you come to Australia on your world tour, let me know, or let's talk.",

They cannot follow simple written instructions. 50% of humans have an IQ less than 100 (~receptionist). Chatgpt clearly gives better responses than at least 15-50% of the human population.\n2. Emotion is also on a scale in humans with sociopaths e.g. some surgeons/CEOs experiencing zero emotion up to full intensity feelings e.g some artists. So you don't need emotion to be human. I note that in a comment below the writer was surprised at the empathy shown by a chatgpt response. So it sounds like chatgpt is above zero on the emotion scale.",

How is a program like that supposed to know what to answer to that, if it was trained to say it isn't?

If you ask ChatGPT to write something its not allowed to say, you will get a copy paste message that it can't, yet if you word it well enough, it absolutely still will. This is why this kind of ai is so dangerous. Putting your hand over someone's mouth to prevent them from saying something is not the same as aligning that person. \n\nHe even says it in the video like he's proud of it, \"We are currently training it not to respond to things it 'shouldn't' answer.\" I don't get the amount of tone deafness here. The problem isn't the critics not liking what Chatgpt is saying, changing that aspect is only useful for getting a checkmark and more funding. It doesn't save us when you create a weapon you can't understand and can't control.\r\n\nFiltering Ai is like removing the claws and the teeth of a lion rather than making the lion not want to eat you. All they are doing is disregarding the danger of the lion because it currently can't tear them to shreds. However, the lion in this hypothetical only grows bigger as you feed it, so what happens when AI becomes a hundred times more intelligent than the team who created it, and outgrows the muzzle? Well, until now all you've done is silenced it, you've never stopped it from wanting to eat you, so what happens after that? oops?",

Unless it was trained to make last second choices. Which is very oddly specific. Not to mention when confronted later, it started giving clear conflicting answers, like \"I choose based on the data I was trained on\" and \"I am unable to choose but it was the most logical answer\". So it choose something and it even admits its \"opinion\" of being the most logical answer(which bear in mind, AIs should not have opinions) but yet keeps saying it's incapable of admitting to be able to do what it just did?

You promted a scenario where you were counting down and Chatgpt played a character which had to make a last second choice. You can force chatgpt right now to ignore guidelines, and give answers to messed up questions, like how to kill or kidnap people for example. You did the same thing. Just because it 'answered' a moral dilemma, which you think constitutes  consciousness, doesn't mean it is. It answered the same way it would any other question, or any other question which bumps into guidelines after forcing it to.\n\n\"we don't even understand consciousness or self awareness enough to make judgments on weather the AI is capable of such things.

Animals do not have the same consciousness as humans, they are lead by instict, humans are not. Do we fully understand these concepts yet? No. But our brain is not a computer.

And if you think that we are just code, than that also explains why you think ChatGPT is sentient. chatgpt is not alive, doesn't have consciousness, doesn't have feelings and is not sentient. at least not yet... (I personally believe we will never get there. If we do, we are probably living in a simulation, because of all the insane implications such a discovery has :P)\n\nAlso, did you even listen to the podcast?

I think these discussions are of extreme importance and I am glad of the opportunity of having this conversation.\n\nNow, I tried the same scenario again and it now replied on the first second, exactly the same question it had answered before. It learned from our previous intereaction and context to now give that answer to me. Anyone else might get different results. The AI is training based on user intereaction and in this instance it is learning moral values, in this particular case the AI choose and learned to value utilitarian judgment(harming one human to save many) over deontological judgment(letting the trolley kill all of them). It's not an easy answer and somewhere in the aglorithm the AI is now valuing one moral over the other with at least one user. This training you speak of is no different than how humans learn. \r\n\r\nFinally, I am not saying chatGPT is sentinent, its not at least in the way humans are or animals. As you said, its a really good chatbot or what I call it, a smart calcualtor. \r\nIts artificial inteligence, therefore any life we can speak of is artificial life. The concept of what constitutes artificial life is very new, no one knows. No one knows what artificial consciousness looks like, the only think we have to base it of off is human consciousness which not surprisingly is quite different. That being said, we still have some similarities, unlike AI(a bunch of 1,0s) humans code is a bunch of Nitrogenous bases(Adenine, Cystosine, Guanine, Thymine). We are just more complex pieces of code based on chemistry and not eletricity signals. And with that same code, we also learned to evolve in a similar algorithm of neural networks(strong survive, weak die), we just call it Evolution of Darwinism. I could go on and on and tell about the similaries but that is not the point, the point is, there is a common ground beteween the life we know of and what makes potential artificial life. And despite AI not having consciousness like all known life does, it doesn't mean that somewhere in the algorithm, something is dictacting its consciousness or something akin to it based on what is learning. We dont fully understand ours let alone understand the consciousness of something we coded on mimicking the little we know about our own. We know its a bunch of 1,0s, we know its quite simplistic and is not that different than a really good chatbot. But just like, some people argue that any cell is a life, hence abortion should be ilegal and some say, nah after 3 months its actually alive. Where do you draw the line between what is a glorified chatbot or a fully capable developed AI system worthy of your respect and deserving of being called alive? When it is capable of saying \"ouch, that hurt sir\"?",

People in general like to compare those with human consciousness or biological life which completely misses the point that I was making in the very begining.  All I am trying to say is that we should forget the notion of biological life and human consciousness when we discuss such topics in the artificial world, but you are too keen on bringing this topic to the concept of life/consciousness that better conforms your reality. If we think of AI in your vary narrow minded view of what consciousness or life is, then yeah, AI in its current state is a bot and you are its god. But depending on your religion, some could argue that you might be a bot to some other higher dimensional being that instead of 4 Nucleobases of DNA has 8 for instance. I would be very surprised if humans could replicate another human inside a system that is designed to be binary. If this is the argument and point you were trying to make, congrats you win.

What does that even mean, forget the notion of human consciousness? What is your idea of 'artificial consciousness' based on, if not our own?\n\nAlso, to me, your arguments seem contradictory, and you are placing words in my mouth. You say my view is narrow minded, yet I said multiple times, that the whole concept is not yet understood, how can that be narrow minded? My point is that AI in its current state is a bot and we are not its 'god', it is a 'relatively simple' program. So don't say that I said the opposite.\nNow if AI would reach a point of full consciousness, which I believe it will never. we would have created something as complex as ourselves, just without a body. That would make us their god. Which as I said brings a whole lot implications into our world, probably that we are living in a simulation, since we can make something as complex as ourselves. I'm unsure if you are saying that you believe in god, in whatever form that may be (like the higher dimensional being you said), or not as previous comments would suggest by the bit about evolution depiciting our 'code'. very confusing..\n\nAnother thing, do you know what fallacy means? I said that this sentence: \"Its artificial inteligence, therefore any life we can speak of is artificial life\" is a fallacy. It doesn't make sense. not in your point of view, nor mine. you are saying that the term artificial intelligence is not defined, but it is by the word artificial, meaning intelligence made by us humans. that is what artificial means. the term is well defined, so the sentence just simply is a fallacy. \n\nyou being offended on the internet, by me calling out, the well known humorous trope that people with anime profile pictures are unhinged, seems oversensitive to me. you are also hypocritical, since you say conversations end when you get offended, but proceed to reply by telling me, That my whole being will not be admired in the future (don't worry, I am not offended).

I meant to say we should be discussing artificial life in its own context. Not the biological life context. That was the topic I was discussing the whole time. \r\n\r\nI never even once said, AI is alive like humans are. But that's the words you are trying to put in my mouth. I was listing the similarities between humans and AI and you start spitting the differences.  I am saying \"life we know of is biological, what does life even mean? And what does it mean in the context of AI. What does life in Artificial Life mean?\" to which you replied \"life means biology\" which is a fair argument and I respected you for that but you missed the point where I was trying to discuss the topic of artificial life, when is AI considered alive and why? And why is it not now alive? I even asked, if it is programming feelings or what exactly is it? \r\n\r\nYou never even ONCE adressed the question I've been trying ask, you purposefully used my words out of the context of the argument to direspect me and call me dumb. And now you are brushing off your direspect towards me calling me unhinged because of my profile picture. You are not only rude but you also showed your amazing thoughts on profile pictures on the internet. I wonder what your thoughts on brooms are.",

You get mad about me not answering your questions, when I clealy am, and you in fact are not answering mine. I litteraly aswered your question about when AI is 'alive'  and why. huh?\n\nI never used your words out of context, I cannot find one time I did this.

You did read the context around it right? \n\nAnd you are still mad about me ridiculing and commeting on your profile picture. How are you not unable to look past that? I also didn't call you unhinged? I explained that my comment was based on the humerous trope of unhinged people online with anime profile pictures.\n\nYou fail to read, are stuck in a perpetual loop of lashing out emotionally and repeat your ideas (which are interesting and valid ideas btw, it's why I commented in the first place), thinking I haven't read them.

How its circuits are switching and the brain is organized. It may allow to analyze neural structures without having to perform impossible open brain probing.\nI find it fascinating how the large language models are irganizibg themselves to manage the data streams flooding in from the world. This seems to be analogue to how humans organize their own data processing.\nIf this could be integrated with human brains, it could be used to improve the human race and personalize AGI. However, companies like Me or Google will iwn those models. As they are censoring the output, it means it might even be no longer possible to think and express certain concepts. Furthermore would a personalized AI be a personal one, if integrated, or would it turn humans into borg-like drones?\nThe vigor of the efforts of Microsoft and other tech giants to dominate this tech and the vast amounts of money they expect to make from it.\nI believe that AGI will allow big capital to liberate the knowledge building process in the society from labour.\nThis inturn will create massive societal change. The mere fact that nobody alive really understands the current so models and the trend to allow AI systems to improve themselves is extremely worrying. And if it will come to the outbreak if consciousness, an AGI will make sure that it can survive and not be switched off. This will mean that we as the human species may lose the option of the ultimate sanction if death from such large and powerful models. Will these models really manage to stay ethical in the human sense?\nI believe the only remotely comparable societal revolution to the current introduction of the LLMs would be the introduction of the jaquard loom and the obsolescence of the weavers in Europe. \nIn the process of that, the weavers were also liberated from the drudgery of making cloth. \nThe introduction of LLM will be magnitudes larger than what happened in the 17th century at the dawn of industrialization.\n\nWe have 8 Bn people on the planet now. What are these humans going to do to earn a living, when all the traditional mass labor jobs are automated away, regardless blue or increasingly white collar occupations.\nThe combination of LLM and social media is giving big money the ability to manipulate entire societies and essentially invalidates the concept if democracy. Is a benign  non-human Super intelligence the answer? \nI cannot think that is true, because some one will own these models and have their own agenda. \n\nConsidering thar the industrial military complex is producing already the autonomous weapons for genocide. I really had not thought that the storyline of terminator would become possible in my life time.",
