We need to get rid of social media, AI, youtube, tik tok, porn, The psychological impacts of these technologies are going to and probably already have sent humanity into a mass psychosis. Carl Jung in the later stages of his life lived without electricity saying that even electricity was too advanced for human psychology to deal with and look at where we are at now. \n\nGood luck everybody! I suggest you all remove as much of this from your life as possible, the first step to breaking out of prison is realizing you are in a prison. We as humanity are all in a collective prison, and the prison's have been designed by these nerds like zuckerburg and bill gates and this guy and they will have the blood of millions on their hands, they are contributing to a mental health crisis and have already caused countless death's of teenage girls by suicide",

Measuring \"correct\" things people say tells us almost nothing about their general intelligence its the absence of \"wrong\" stuff or reflective handling of mistakes that shows us how intelligent someone/something is).

I simply can't think of an outcome that really makes the world a better place. We kind of already live in a state of post scarcity. We produce more food than we need. We have a lot of stuff figured out. We are not too stupid. We are too stubborn. We cling to our instinctual heritage and pretend that we have to claw resources from our neighboring village. How will AI help with that without taking complete control and subjugating humans? What would a world look like after the most positive outcome we can think of? Even if a super-AI would be without any doubt benevolent and trying to better us as humans: what would be our role in such a world? Being cared for? Is that what we want? What remains of human agency if the system we built can take care of stuff better than we can? What remains of meaning? Do we really want to make ourselves obsolete?\n\"How useful is that to people? How much delight does that bring people? How much does that help them create a much better world, new science, new products, new services, whatever.\"\n\nThat's not the at least somewhat concise vision of a \"much better world\" i am hoping for. Our science will be meaningless, because AI will have already done it and pat us on the back. Products and services? Really? Don't we have to much of those?\n\nWe need meaning, purpose, time, connection, peace of mind, knowledge about our individual selves, self control, sophistication, a certain frugality and awareness of our own needs. We DO NOT need more \"products and services\". How can such a brilliant mind come up with such a stale outlook for \"a much better world\"?\n\nUSA-mindset, i can hear you!",

        "comment": "I asked CHAT GPT to make a D&D character using D&D 3.5. and I discovered it couldn't learn from mistakes. The program doesn't use the point buy system from DMG p 169 where all stats start at 8 and it cost one point to raise a stat to by 1 up to and including 14 so 14 cost 6 points, 15 cost 8 pts, 16 10 pts, 17 13 pts and 18 16 points.   It said the rule was 1 point up to and includes 13 so 14 costs 7 points but this is incorrect according to the DMG. look it up for yourselves. I told it the rules and it could not buy 30 points of abilities. It would get the math wrong at almost every step. It couldn't spend 30 points it would spend more or less. I finally wrote a set of rules to get it to rinse and repeat any time it failed to spend exactly 30 points. Finally giving me a correct result. i asked it to do it again and it failed. \n\nIt would give the wrong stat bonuses for races even AFTER it correctly listed the stat bonuses. It felt like it was just spewing random numbers at me instead of actually making a character. I gave it detailed instructions that worked for 1 iteration and when i asked it to repeat the process it broke and gave me incorrect results and it forgot the rules I had told it. So many times it would get teh stat blocks wrong for the race and often the stat block wasn't right for any version of D&D or pathfinder. It did not feel at all intelligent but stupid and poorly programed. Which I was surprised about. It didn't seem capable of following the rules to make a character. Ironically I know there are programs that can randomly generate characters using a \"dumb\" program and there are 100% rules accurate. So either chatGPT was lying to me or it is fooling people into thinking it is \"smart.\"",

In times of turmoil, more control is needed  & systems gravitate to centralized control.\nIn times of calm or safety, less direct control is needed and it can be more distributed and democratized. \n\nMaybe AI itself can one day help us strike a better balance and help humanity experience longer and longer periods of calm and safety where control can be more distributed and democratized.",

Are you really asking me that? Lex Fridman is obviously a Russian spy! I mean, just look at him with that stoic expression and those piercing eyes.
