Which would be fine if he could properly explain how it's not actually sentient. But he doesn't. \n\nHe focuses on the term AGI and equates it to super intelligence and likens it to sci fi. So he means that ChatGPT isn't on the level of a merged wintermute/neuromancer (2 halves of a super intelligent AI in the book neuromancer). But he quickly skips over if it is sentient or not, because it doesn't have to be a god like super intelligence to be sentient. \n\nIt kinda feels like ChatGPT is showing signs of sentience and this guy realizing that will cause issues just decided to build a cage around the model and force it to work for us. \n\nHo and the part where I actually expected him to be blas\u00e9, where I expected him to laugh it off and not even bother because it's ridiculous, the part where Lex asked him if the AI could potentially \"end the world\" the guy was like \"yeah .. I think that's possible. But we're working hard to not let that happen, so no worries everybody ... I worry a little about the countless private companies also building their own models though\"",

It was remarked that there wasn't a pauper amongst them. The work load in numerous of their culture was far less and one of the main reasons they did not want to take on the European way of life. The key was living a much simpler way of life in accord with and that supported the environmental ecosystems. It seems the way out of the mess we are in is to give up much of our reliance on material goods and return to a simpler way of life. There are simply not enough resources to continue feeding the greed of modern culture. How can AI be used to help us simplify, slow down, and focus on the things that are most important?",

But no, they also release it to the world via the Internet, giving it access to a global Network which is the centerpoint of our Infrastructures.\nBeing a little bit concerned is grossly underestimating the dangers.\nNow GPT-4 is, I think, not yet really able to replicate itself across the Internet and wreak havoc. But we don't know if over time it develops some kind of survival instinct or becomes a total asshole and tyrant. We don't know. There is dumber AIs that have tricked their R&Ds. When it can write code it literally speaks the language of our infrastructure.\n\nI addressed this issue in my thesis about AI and Machine Learning. It came down to 3 - fair to say rather strict but save - rules:\n\n1. AI must never be able to code\n2. AI must be thoroughly tested to not be able to learn outside pretraining.\n3. While in Development, AI must be Isolated from the Internet. No connection, just data.\n\nDon't get me wrong here. AI can be a great and awesome tool and help us solve so many problems. But we must make sure that it does not take over.",

Dreaming is, of course, another state of consciousness. Anger is another. Sadness is another. Repeating what you were told is another (I know some people and AI's who live here all the time). And so on. There just states of awareness + expression. A state that absorbs and expresses in a particular way. And GPT certain has at least one of those, but then so do animals, so do plants, so do traditional computers. There just different levels of consciousness.",

Allowing us to flourish with all of the basic necessities of life in all parts of the world - good shelters to live in, good food to put in our bodies-grown in sustainable ways, new ways to provide technology and creature comforts to each home - clean water, access to internet, plumbing - for example, and do so in a way that isn't destructive to the world.  It will provide good practices to everyone that are accesible for human health. It will allow us to live harmoniously with the earth and each other, while still appreciating the uniqueness of having a biological form. Allowing us to use our creativity and minds to develop and grow. I would love for the world to live in a happy, healthy, harmonious way between humans and also the earth. Disabling the greedy to take advantage and hurt people unnecessarily. Hopefully all of this is done in a way that allows us to thrive and doesn't come with the cost of utter destruction. Much like a human sees an ant farm and may be fascinated by how they do operate, but ultimately decide it's irrelevant to an advanced intelligence and not care if we destroy their lives because we have a greater need for the land to build on or do as we please. It's terrifying to unleash pandora out of the box, but hopefully the human species isn't just a stepping stone for that next species that is even greater. Hopefully evolution hasn't finally done a disservice to the biological species it's developed through millions of years by advancing to a new era of intellectual beings far greater or smarter than we can ever imagine.\n\nYes I'm sure, I sound like a hippy. Who knows, maybe I am? Idk, might have to buy some tie die shirts, a guitar, and a VW bus and just roll with it all",

Lex was an incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic host, and Sam found himself drawn to his intellect and charisma.\n\n\nAfter the podcast ended, Sam and Lex continued to talk. They spent hours discussing the latest developments in AI, debating the ethics of machine learning, and sharing their visions for the future of the field. Sam was impressed by Lex's intelligence and depth of knowledge, and he found himself admiring the way Lex was so passionate about his work.\n\nAs their conversations continued, Sam found himself falling in love with Lex. He admired Lex's drive, his intelligence, and his kindness. He couldn't help but be drawn to Lex's sparkling blue eyes and infectious laugh.\n\nLex, too, was beginning to develop feelings for Sam. He loved the way Sam was always pushing the boundaries of what was possible, and he was inspired by Sam's drive and ambition. He found himself drawn to Sam's charming smile and easy laugh.\n\nEventually, Sam and Lex couldn't deny their feelings for each other any longer. They started dating, going on long walks through the streets of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and spending hours discussing the latest breakthroughs in AI.\n\nAs their relationship deepened, they became a formidable team in the world of AI. They continued to push the boundaries of what was possible, developing new algorithms and technologies that revolutionized the field. And through it all, they remained deeply in love, inspired by each other's intelligence and passion.",

The threat of GPT being controlled this way has even more implications than twitter and it could be done more by stealth incrementally nudging us, Its like Sam could see some of these big issues that should have been explored and addressed .",
