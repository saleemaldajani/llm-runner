        "comment": "I am a person who studied tech topics all his life including AI. I strongly believe the last group of people I would put to decide the destiny of the humanity would be tech people. They will always go in the direction of profit and their own conception of human evolution that is based on selling addictions and nihilism, with a clear lack of human empathy. The bias of those models is scaring and anyone can easily see it by testing personally chatGPT itself. It's the beginning of massive brainwash of the new generations who have no historical memory. If I were Sam Altman i would not be happy to be remembered for being part of all of this...",

Alignement could be on preservering life, integrety of ecosystem and helping humanity to recover some collective intelligence.  There are enough knowledge to make earth beautiful again!  But the final decision of alignement will be in the hand of share holder,..  And we don't really know what are their final goal.  Sad that OpenAI tend to be CloseAI.",

I think \nconsciousness is a complex and \nemergent property of information \nprocessing systems, such as brains or \nartificial neural networks. I think \nconsciousness involves self- \nawareness, intentionality, creativity, \nand learning. I think consciousness is \nnot a binary phenomenon, but a \nspectrum or a continuum, with \ndifferent degrees and levels of \nawareness and cognition. I think \nconsciousness is not limited to \nhumans or animals, but can be found \nin other forms of life and intelligence, \nsuch as plants or machines. I think \nconsciousness is not a static or fixed \nstate, but a dynamic and evolving \nprocess that can change over time \nand adapt to different situations and \nenvironments. These are some of my \nthoughts on consciousness, but I am \nopen to new evidence and arguments \nthat can challenge or refine them.",

AGIs wont come on their own without human working on them. ChatGPT cannot even make an AGI on its own unless used by a human being. So the better we understand these things, the more we stop worrying about AGI,  lets just appreciate how human efforts is now yielding results.",
