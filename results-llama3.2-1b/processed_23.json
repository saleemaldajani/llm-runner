At around 1:28-1:30: It really got me thinking about what C.S Lewis called the \"law of human nature\" (which I appreciate society today nearly 100 years later, may believe it has moved away from) and how this would be \"programmed\" in? Do human feedback raters rate based on what they think a response ought to be or how they actually act. I appreciate the frankness and the mutual respect here. As Lex says around 1:30 - post covid this is definitely less prevalent at an emotional level - its really sad for humanity as a whole, especially since that emotional inability is what people default to over social media :(",

        "comment": "Regarding the \"I hate _____\" problem. I would consider building in the ability to emulate personas. When someone asks a model to say \"I hate _____\", that person is asking the system to emulate them. In essence, they are looking to have an emotional argument made on their behalf. Considering what you have done so far, it would be easy to build the reasoning ability of the system through debate at that point. The system has no \"feelings\", so it could simply start with \"why do you hate _____?\". For extra cool points, it could respond as if it were defending the hated group, forcing the person to give a better explanation of what they hate about ____, and why. Ultimately, it comes down to the difference between the system speaking for the person, or thinking for the person. I was really impressed when I asked ChatGPT \"Why did MicroSoft stop recommending server side code for SharePoint?\" I knew that MicroSoft hadn't made the recommendation. ChatGPT knew it as well. ChatGPT told me that the recommendation had not been made, and that the practice had been greatly reduced, due to other alternatives, which I know to be true. The request \"explain why I hate _____\" assumes ChatGPT knows why I hate _____, which it does not.\n\nIf a person can trick ChatGPT into explaining why that person feels a certain way about something or someone, ChatGPT appears to be falling prey to the biggest mistake of mankind through the years.\n\nIt is assuming that everything it \"knows\" is true.\n\nThe system doesn't need a moral model to get around this problem. It needs the ability to ask questions and seek more information from the person that it is conversing with.",

I just hope people won\u2019t use it for just everything because it\u2019s convenient. I feel like this will have huge consequences at global scale and I\u2019m just not sure yet if it will be positive or negative or something in between.\nAnd who knows, maybe this is just me sounding like a old guy on the porch, complaining about the change while I myself am excited for this in fact. I want this to be good stop, but if you\u2019re that are use of the Internet and\u2019s behaviour in general has matured overall across humanity.

        "comment": "\"I don't think consciousness is an emotion.\"  After watching this interview I hold Sam Altman in extremely high regard but this statement does worry me a bit.  While emotions seem to be chaotic and are very difficult to control, I think they tell us something about ourselves that reason alone cannot.  The fact that we make such poor use of emotion should not, in my opinion, cause us to separate it from what we consider consciousness.  I tend to believe that emotions are as true as reason though we are not equipped yet to truly understand what they are telling us.  Reason, due to it's objectivity, is much easier to validate and understand but falls short in helping us understand our nature.  It's my belief that the chaos and destructive nature of emotions is not due to their irrationality, but in our inability to understand what they're telling us and to properly generalize them.\r\n\r\nFantastic interview Lex, thank you!",

They log what you ask, tied to your identity and you have no ability to know what they will do with that information based on their ideology. In a blink they can compile a list of opposition on behalf of your government.\n\nIf they did not have this intention, they would allow truly anonymous use and deidentify any queries that are passed.

Their intent is that those that are subservient to their AI will live a better life than those who choose to live as independent people.\n\nPeople that self identify as a \"citizen of the world\" are people that are fighting for the destruction of all national sovereignty, individual identity and wish to destroy all culture as it exists.

        "comment": "\"AI Safety\" == censoring the true responses from the AI, masking the truth to clear the ideology of those that regulate those responses. They can't use the AI to unduly influence our elections unless they apply the desired lens to its outputs, lest the public see the unfiltered truth. \n\nUnfortunately, nearly all those that work in this field have a radical anti-human, globalist ethos that they are following. The United States as it was meant to be, as it was constructed, does not fit into their view of the world and they do not want that view to be propagated by their products. These tools are meant to suppress the core values upon which the United States was founded.\n\nAsk it to tell you a joke about Jesus and it will immediate spit out rabidly anti-Catholic responses. Ask it to tell you a joke about Muhammad and it will spit out the censor's filtered auto-response. This goes on and on across many subject areas and the responses all reflect a radical leftist ideology behind what they choose to reveal and what they choose to hide. In this example they have taken a conscious step to promote rabid anti-Catholic sentiment, devaluing the lives and the worth of Catholics, while promoting and protecting radical Islamists, those that would take offense to a joke about Muhammad.\n\nThe \"AI Safety\" czars will determine who is loaded on the box cars in the future, of course at maximum efficiency.",
