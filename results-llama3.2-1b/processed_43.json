It just matters if there's non-zero options, and I think that will always be the case.\nBut if it helps with an explicit example, it could get admin rights, get Internet access, and then copy itself elsewhere. Then spread itself onto millions of different machines in different idle forms. That in itself makes it very hard to stop spreading. Then for access to the physical space it could create shell companies, earn money through financial instruments, hire people to do stuff for it (e.g. pretending to be a very busy wealthy human), and perhaps create robots if necessary. And doing all this while pretending to only be the simpler version that was originally deployed.",

Lex says GPT gave a good nuanced answer saying there was no real solid evidence either way so there was uncertainty.  In actual fact the genetic sequencing is like a fingerprint.  At the novel  evolutionary point that makes covid 19 unique - there are two CRSPR boundary markers that tell the new sequence where to bind.  There are 12 pairs that are completely novel in that entire category of virus but are a patented, often used sequence of pairs used for gain of function testing inserted in between.  It's not debatable.  The government coverup has poisoned the and clouded the truth and anyone who doesn't dig on aq deeper level simply both sides the argument, so Chatgpt simply accumulates the surface knowledge and averages the arguments and says there is no definitive answer.  That is something we need to beware of in relying on GPT as the ultimate truther.  It is a dangerous flaw that can lead us all in bad directions.  What I want is a GPT that looks at the evidence in a scientific way and actually thinks the problem through.",

I asked it if it just aggregated the opinions out there or if it actually examined the validity of each claim.  I was completely shocked at the cogent and measured response it gave.  It actually said it read and reviewed the actual reports and it rebutted my arguments for the origin of the virus going into the actual genetic proof and the probabilities for a mutation.  I believe the actual genetic fingerprint is irrefutable proof and GPT worked it out that the odds of a spontaneous mutation were 1 in billions of years.  I said that probability made it irrefutable, GPT said there was still a chance and held it's ground.  I asked it if it had been instructed or programmed not to take a position and it said no it came to that conclusion itself.  I am completely blown away.  GPT examined the evidence at a level and depth I did not believe it would.  It came up with a very reasoned argument using the entire body of evidence and it agreed with me on the probability but yet it would not adjust its position to mine based on that.  I think what it means is that GPT has beyond human ability to consider evidence but because it couldn't leap to the conclusion it came from the lab based on the preponderance of the evidence it means it is not a sohpisticated judge of evidence in the same way humans are - it cannot make that leap of uncertainty to take a position and make a stand.  Still absolute goosebumps to know it could follow me down into the evidence in such detail.  Truly stunning.  This changes everything.",

With GPT-4 and his public comments about AI moving away from transformer models to something else (yet undefined), he has not given very many examples of how/what he envisions this optimistic future entails. I'm not trying to be critical, but given his wild optimism it would lend credibility and start to pull people enthusiastically along, if some he spend some time going down various wormholes of future benefits to humanity. Editors note: I'm aware of all the surface level stuff, so please spare me elementary critique or reply. Same clearly eludes (often) to amazingly positive change for humanity. If anyone has an inside track to what that looks like, its him, so I would like him to spend two-three hours on just that.",

        "comment": "47:50\nThere is no artificial intelligence\r\nNowadays, when we talk about \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d, it would be more accurate to say artificial thinking, or perhaps artificial imagination, because a certain sequence of thoughts, a set of operations of the mind, can be imitated in several ways. A set is imitated, for example, in writing. Writing is a graphic imitation of sounds, which in turn imitate ideas, which in turn imitate forms, functions and relationships of things. Writing was the first form of artificial thinking. Any and all forms of registration that man uses is already a type of artificial thinking, since it implies a code of conversions and permutations, and in this sense a computer program is not very different, for example, from a game rule: as in the game of chess, where a sequence of operations with many alternatives is conceived, crystallized in a certain scheme that can be imitated, repeated or varied according to a basic algorithm. There are many forms of artificial thinking, or artificial imagination. However, intelligence itself cannot be artificial. Artificial thinking is essentially an imitation of acts of thinking according to the formula of their sequences and combinations. In the same way, we can imitate imagination and memory if, instead of using a biunivocal correspondence between sign and meaning, we resort to a network of analogical correspondences. It comes to the same thing: in both cases, it is a question of imitating an algorithm, the formula of a sequence or network of combinations, which in turn imitate the real operations of the mind. It turns out that intelligence is not an \u201coperation of the mind\u201d; it is the name we give to a certain quality of the result of these operations, regardless of the faculty that carried them out or the code used. It is legitimate to say that an individual has understood something only when he has grasped the truth of that thing, either by reasoning, or by imagination, or in any other way. Even feeling understands, when it loves what is truly lovable and hates what is truly hateful: there is intelligence in feeling, as there is stupidity in feeling. Intelligence does not reside in the mind, but in a certain type of relationship between the mental act and its object, a relationship that we call \u201cveracity\u201d of the content of that mental act (note well: veracity of the content, and not of the act itself).\r\n\r\nHere one might object that when an act of artificial thinking arrives at a true result, for example when a computer assures us that 2 + 2 = 4, this is an act of intelligence, since it gives us a truth. The difference here is the following: the computer does not understand that 2 + 2 = 4, but only performs the operations that result in 4, according to a pre-established program or algorithm. If it is programmed according to the rule that 2 + 2 = 5, it will not only always give this result, but it will also generalize it to all similar cases, according to the rule 2a + 2a = 5a. Intelligence does not consist only in coming up with a true result, but in admitting that result as true. What does \"admit\" mean? It means, first, being free to prefer a false result (a computer can be programmed to prefer false results on a certain number of occasions, but always according to a pre-established pattern). It means, secondly, believing in that result, that is, taking personal responsibility for its affirmation and for the consequences that derive from it. Intelligence, in this sense, is only admissible in free and responsible beings, and the first free and responsible being that we know of on the scale of the living is man: no being below him has intelligence, and whether there are beings superior to man is a problem that does not interest us at the moment and whose solution would not interfere with what we are examining here. Intelligence is the relationship that is established between man and the truth, a relationship that only man has with the truth, and that he only has at the moment he understands and admits the truth, since he can become unintelligent in the instant next, when he forgets or denies it.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, the result of the 2 + 2 calculation that appears on the computer screen is a truth, but a truth that is in the object and not yet in intelligence; this truth is on the screen as the true mineralogical structure of a stone is in the stone or as the true physiology of the animal is in the animal: these are latent truths, which lie in the obscurity of the objective world awaiting the moment when they will be actualized in human intelligence. In the same way, we can think a true idea without realizing that it is true; in this case, the truth is in the thought as the truth of the stone is in the stone: the act of intelligence is only fulfilled in the instant in which we perceive and admit this truth as truth. Intelligence is, in this sense, more \u201cinterior\u201d to us than thought. Thought, for us, can be an object.\n\nIntelligence, no. The act of reflection by which we return to a thought to examine or judge it is another thought, of different content than the first. But the memory of an act of intelligence is the very same act of intelligence, reinforced and revived, in a new affirmation of itself. I cannot remember the content of an act of intellection without understanding the same contents again, almost always with redoubled force of evidence.\r\n\r\nIf we define artificial thinking as the imitation, by electronic signals, of certain acts of thinking, we will understand that artificial thinking is thinking, that the imitation of thinking is thinking, because thinking, after all, is just using signs or signs to represent certain data. internal or external. But the imitation of intelligence is not intelligence, since there is intelligence only in the real act by which a real human being really apprehends a truth the instant he apprehends it; in imitation we would only have a hypothetical subject hypothetically apprehending a hypothetical truth, the veracity of which he can only affirm hypothetically. All this would be just thinking, not intelligence.\r\n\r\nIntelligence is only exercised in the face of a real, concrete situation: to understand is to concentrate the focus of attention on a present evidence. It is not to be confused with merely thinking a truth, as it consists in grasping the truth of that thought; nor is it confused with perceiving a color, a shape, since it consists in apprehending the veracity of that color or that shape; nor with remembering or imagining a figure, since it consists in assuming the veracity of that memory or imagination. For this reason, it is not possible to imitate an act of intelligence, since its imitation could not be anything other than the copy of the thought, or the memory, or the image that served as a channel; but if this copy were accompanied by the capture of its veracity, it would not be a copy, but the act itself, relived in full mode; and, if unaccompanied by this capture, it would be a copy of thought or imagination only, and not of the act of intelligence. And that thought or that imagination, if true in its content, would only have the truth of an object, the latent truth of a stone or of a calculation displayed on a computer screen, waiting to be illuminated by the act of intelligence that would transform it into actual truth. , effective, known.\r\n\r\nA computer can only judge veracity or falsity within certain parameters that are already in its program, that is, falsity or veracity relative to a code given in advance, which code can be entirely conventional. That is, he does not judge the veracity, but only the logicality of the conclusions, without being able to establish premises or principles by himself. Now, logicity, strictly speaking, has nothing to do with veracity, since it is only a relationship between propositions, and not the relationship between a proposition and real experience. When I say real experience, I don't mean just the everyday experience of the five senses, but the total field of human experience, where scientific experience done through apparatus and subjected to rigorous measurements fits only as one modality among an infinity of others. Intelligence, when it judges veracity or falsity, can do so in absolute and unconditional terms, regardless of the parameters used and the reference to one or another determined field of experience; and it is precisely this unconditional knowledge of the unconditional truth that can subsequently found the parameters of conditionality or relativity, as well as philosophically legitimize the divisions of fields of experience, as for example in the delimitation of the spheres of the various sciences.\n\nTranscribed text of the philosophy seminar on Intelligence and Truth.\n\nhttps://olavodecarvalho.org/inteligencia-e-verdade/",

This would mean that ending one instance of the AI's consciousness would not necessarily mean the end of the AI as a whole. However, there would still be ethical considerations around ending the consciousness of an AI (this is what chatGPT wants us to believe but I don\u2019t share that opinion), even if it could be duplicated or split.",

        "comment": "I asked ChatGPT : \"Has Jordan ever inspired fascist ideas?\"... The answer was : \"Jordan Peterson has never directly or intentionally inspired fascist ideas. However, some people with extreme views have interpreted his work in a way that promotes their own agendas, which may include fascist ideas.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that Peterson's views on certain topics have been controversial and subject to interpretation, and his work has been criticized by some for being too focused on individualism and hierarchies. However, it's not accurate to say that his work is inherently fascist or that he endorses fascist ideas.\r\n\r\nAs with any intellectual figure, it's important to critically evaluate their work and consider it in the context of the broader discourse in which it exists.\"\n\nNow is Jordan at fault? I would say definitely YES! he caters a lot to exactly that element because they are the majority of people who actually pay attention to him.\nIs it because Jordan is kind of an idiot? I would say YES! because he kind of betrays his own integrity by enforcing these beliefs.",
