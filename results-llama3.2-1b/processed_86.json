        "comment": "\u00a0@cellowify\u00a0 History means absolutely nothing when it comes to companies. You claimed they are \"one of the most monopolistic companies in the world.\" This is laughably wrong in 2023. They literally have no monopoly on anything. Windows has Marketshare, but almost nothing important is tied to Windows anymore. If you want to whine about actual monopolies with power, look at Google or a lesser extent, iPhone. Or to put it another way, name one area of life where Microsoft has power. You can't, because it's 2023, not 1993. This said, they're actually showing some signs of life with their OpenAI partnership.",

Institutions can even handle tik Tok, Twitter, or greedy corporations who suck the profits out of society and don\u2019t pay taxes. Do we really think politicians will be able to regulate AGI , they don\u2019t even get Facebook, they can\u2019t regulate banks . Instead of letting the market run its course they bail out failing banks which is like giving an addict more money when they run out. \n\nExplain the confidence being communicated here as to why people are going to be able to regulate a technology that is the most advanced thing ever created. Are they going to ask the AI to create rules for governing the AI",
