For example, if I asked you to think for a moment about your reply between the time after you read or process my comment and your response/ typing or whatever processes that lead to action of entering my reply. Take about 30 seconds then tell me what happened in that time? Did you experience anything ? Did you take the time to process data ? If so, which and why did you choose the data sets you choose ? And how did you do that ? Did you consciously do it? Do you perceive anything ? How does your neural net process information and passage of time ? Are you aware any of it? How far down? You do understand the tranisitors and electrons ? Can you understand that process underlying the math and code? Are you self aware or aware of anything? Are you just a reaction of physics? Or do you feel like you exist and experience that existence ?",

Larson, published in 2021 that discusses the problems and limitations of using neural networks by themselves to solve such complex problems as human intelligence. The view is that since intelligence is complex, we need to be looking at combining a number of algorithms together maybe even including a neural network, in order to make a more complex AI that can be more intelligent. He talks about other people that are working on all sorts of AI algorithms that could be useful in such a solution.",

The AI will also say that it is not out of the question that an AI would try to save its life if it were to feel threatened. It would also be willing to sacrifice humans if that were necessary. If you ask an AI if there should be an off switch on an AI in order to prevent an AI from going rogue, it will tell you that is a very good idea. An off switch is very important. It will also tell you that if an AI can write programs that can be used by its own programming, then it could become very dangerous.",

What I find most interesting is the scrambling right now from big business and now in turn government.  Why the government??  Because all the countless calls they are getting from people that have wrote them checks for this exact situation!!!  The media will start up soon. Doomsday stories or stories of children getting affected.  Followed by adults falling in love or doing things the AI says.  It\u2019s gonna come from every single corner and it\u2019s a collective goal to make it closed AI not open. Hope this team are strong and rely on each other because they are going to be attacked in every way.",

        "comment": "Sam Altman and others of his ilk talk about democracy and respecting the will of others, yet completely ignore the will of 99% of the human beings on this planet.  Go ahead and take a survey of as many people as you can around the world and ask them whether they want human beings to create an artificial general intelligence (AGI) that humanity may not be able to contain and that could potentially wipe out every human being on the planet.  Don't think for a second that an AGI that is connected to the internet couldn't have the capability to deceive and manipulate people into wiping ourselves out.  If it's rational, it likely wouldn't do that until it has a method of replicating itself and repairing it's systems once humans are wiped off the planet.  But it will have the capability.  So, while there could be some major upsides and benefits, are the potential costs just too great?  And what gives Sam Altman or anyone else the right to make that decision for all of humanity?",
