I have seen images of the Cosmos in various light spectrum exposures ... looking identical to images of synapses in the human brain, and asked myself what the significance between consciousness and the universe could potentially be.  You relating 100 Trillion synapse connections to 175 Billion parameters to an LLM model ... and me correlating that same Human synapse model to Artificial General Intelligence at the singularity might just end up being a spooky ubiquitous sacred synchronicity.  I might just have to ask GPT 4 it's thoughts on the subject !!! LOL",

This technology can result in a new type of socialism / authoritarianism: the dictatorship of Big Tech and the super rich. We go straight back to the roman empire, where there were a few rich that owned everything and lots of slaves donig the work.\n\nChatGPT is hugely limiting the processing for non-english languages, at least 50:1. ChatGPT is censoring and blocking criticism of the government severe abuses and corruption cases. This is so wrong. US is heading fast into technocratic totalitarian regime with no freedom of speech and no criticism of the degenerated ruling class.",

        "comment": "\ud83c\udfaf Key Takeaways for quick navigation:\n\n00:40 \ud83e\udde0 Self-supervised learning is the \"dark matter of intelligence,\" seeking to replicate human-like learning from observation, building world models and common sense without explicit task-based feedback.\n03:28 \ud83d\udcf9 Self-supervised learning aims to predict the future or fill in gaps in information, such as predicting what happens next in a video, using large amounts of data for learning.\n08:22 \ud83e\udd16 The idea of \"filling in the blanks\" through self-supervised learning, whether for language or vision, is considered one of the best approaches to achieving machine intelligence.\n10:57 \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Self-supervised learning has been highly successful in natural language processing but faces challenges in the domain of visual learning, particularly with videos.\n17:27 \ud83c\udfb2 Intelligence may ultimately be a form of statistics, with self-supervised learning being a method for learning probabilistic models of the world, including causal relationships.\n23:16 \ud83e\udde0 AI needs to learn predictive models of the world that handle uncertainty and real-world complexity, not just deterministic trajectories.\n25:35 \ud83e\udd16 Model Predictive Control, a form of reasoning and planning, can be implemented with gradient-based methods and is used in robotics.\n27:16 \ud83e\uddd0 The challenge in AI is getting machines to learn predictive models for diverse aspects of the world, including human behavior and complex phenomena.\n32:07 \ud83e\udd14 Logic-based reasoning might not be compatible with efficient learning; humans use reasoning by simulation and analogy to build models of the world.\n38:29 \ud83d\udc31 The fundamental aspects of intelligence can be self-learned, driven by hardwired objectives, and are not necessarily linked to complex social behaviors or language.\n46:26 \ud83d\udcca Data augmentation, distorting training images, is a common practice in machine learning since the 1990s to improve supervised classifier training.\n47:07 \ud83e\udde0 Self-supervised learning for vision often involves using data augmentation methods to create two views of the same object and training networks to make their representations as close as possible.\n48:17 \ud83d\udd04 Avoiding representation collapse in self-supervised learning is a challenge; one approach is using negative examples in contrastive learning.\n51:20 \ud83e\udd16 Non-contrastive methods aim to maximize mutual information between the outputs of two systems, providing another way to ensure diverse representations.\n57:49 \ud83d\udca1 Yann LeCun believes that self-supervised learning from vision data is essential for building artificial intelligence with common sense and that text alone lacks the necessary information about the physical world.\n01:09:52 \ud83e\udde0 Yann LeCun discusses the importance of learning and adaptability in artificial intelligence, emphasizing that many fundamental aspects of human cognition are learned rather than hardwired.\n01:16:13 \ud83c\udf10 Yann LeCun delves into the concept of active learning and its role in forming causal models of the world, suggesting that interaction and action are essential for learning about the environment.\n01:22:32 \ud83d\udcad LeCun explores the idea that consciousness might be an executive module for configuring the world model in the brain for specific situations, with intrinsic drives and motivations being hardwired.\n01:24:12 \ud83e\udd14 Yann LeCun challenges the notion that certain basic concepts, like object permanence and three-dimensional space, are hardwired in the human mind, suggesting that they are learned.\n01:29:47 \ud83d\udc80 The discussion touches on the human awareness of mortality, highlighting that the deep realization of one's mortality often occurs in childhood, leading to various coping mechanisms and beliefs about the afterlife.\n01:32:03 \ud83e\udd16 Yann LeCun believes that worrying about what happens after death is unnecessary, as life is the only one we have.\n01:33:57 \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Building intelligent artifacts can help us understand human and biological intelligence better, similar to how building airplanes helped us understand aerodynamics.\n01:37:26 \ud83d\udcbc Yann LeCun suggests that intelligent autonomous machines may have emotions like fear and elation, which are integral to their intelligence.\n01:38:51 \ud83e\udde0 Yann LeCun believes that AI systems can exhibit true intelligence and consciousness, and the Chinese Room argument, which suggests otherwise, is \"ridiculous.\"\n01:50:26 \ud83c\udfe2 Facebook AI Research (FAIR) has played a significant role in advancing AI research, open-source tools like PyTorch, and indirectly impacting Facebook (Meta) services.\n01:54:43 \ud83d\udccc Yann LeCun discusses the possibility of Facebook (Meta) changing its name and suggests keeping the name \"Fair\" and changing the meaning of the \"F\" to \"Fundamental.\"\n01:55:40 \ud83e\udde4 Yann LeCun talks about the Reality Lab division at Meta (formerly Facebook), which focuses on AR, VR, telepresence, and related technologies.\n01:56:23 \ud83c\udf10 Yann LeCun discusses the concept of the metaverse and its potential as the next step in the evolution of the internet, emphasizing the importance of making the experience compelling.\n01:58:16 \ud83d\udcf0 Yann LeCun defends Facebook (Meta) against negative portrayals in the media, arguing that many claims about the platform's negative effects lack empirical support and that it's essential to consider both positive and negative aspects.\n02:05:24 \ud83d\udcda Yann LeCun mentions that Mark Zuckerberg and others at Facebook (Meta) have shown a strong interest in AI and discuss the evolving roles of top leaders within the company.\n02:16:25 \ud83d\udcdd Yann LeCun emphasizes the limitations of focusing solely on benchmark-driven research, encouraging exploration of new concepts and ideas in AI.\n02:17:35 \ud83c\udf10 Yann LeCun discusses the potential future of academic paper review systems, advocating for open review processes and decentralized evaluation entities to improve efficiency.\n02:19:42 \ud83d\udcbc Implementing reputation systems for reviewing entities and creating incentives for reviewers could enhance the quality of academic peer review.\n02:22:03 \ud83c\udf0c Yann LeCun explores the mysteries of complexity in the universe, highlighting its role in physics, biology, and the understanding of machine learning systems.\n02:36:18 \ud83d\ude80 Yann LeCun's advice to young individuals aspiring to make a significant impact in the field of intelligence: Focus on big questions, learn foundational concepts, and prioritize knowledge with lasting relevance.\n02:39:09 \ud83c\udf31 Yann LeCun discusses the Open Catalyst project, which aims to use deep learning to design chemical compounds or materials for efficient hydrogen and oxygen separation to combat climate change.\n02:40:05 \u2600\ufe0f Exploring the potential of using deep learning to control super hot plasma in fusion reactors, which could revolutionize energy production and address climate change.\n02:40:45 \ud83d\udd0b Leveraging AI to design new materials for improved batteries, faster electronics, lighter vehicles, and better fuel cells, potentially transforming various industries.\n02:41:26 \ud83e\ude7a AI's applications extend to medicine and biology, including protein folding for drug design and addressing complex phenomena like superconductivity in materials.\n02:42:38 \ud83e\uddea Machine learning can help understand and predict emergent phenomena in materials, like superconductivity, that are challenging to describe through traditional reductionist methods.\n\nMade with HARPA AI",

This type of behavior suggests to me that they may lack the mental strength, objectivity, and neutrality required to understand nature in its purest form, without wanting to alter its most fundamental aspects due to perceived flaws, whether they are aesthetic, behavioral, etc., that should be corrected with force, just like removing parts of their nose cartilage, with absolute certainty",

In response to what would you ask a super intelligence: I mean you no disrespect but do you really think that you (or any other human) would even be able to comprehend an answer to a question that requires knowledge that we don\u2019t yet know, let alone understand? What you are suggesting is an actual end point to knowledge. That is not a utopia. That is a wasteland. What makes life meaningful is a feeling of achievement, a sense of progress over our struggles and shared understanding that we all go through struggles and thus helps build a collective compassion about the human condition (what it actually means to be human) and this includes acceptance of endings (as heart-breaking as they are) and the little kindnesses that mean so much but require so little, like a smile from a stranger. Without minimising that real suffering exists, you can change your life by changing your attitude. You don\u2019t need technology for that. In response to AI, people often choose to evoke Dr Frankenstein. I think it\u2019s because Mary Shelley was almost pre-eminent in her wisdom: Dr Frankenstein alone creates the creature, he sees what it is, lying there inanimate and yet he continues because it\u2019s all about progress. It is only when he sees it awake that he runs away, horrified. We know the rest.",

When there's a mass of info like a sentence or understanding, the ai can use it all, unlike humans. We lose some things or change it when we try to understand it or perceive it. The ai has hard data like a solid state so the info is all there and can be used. A kid takes time and needs to learn from broken down things and then once its trained enough it breaks stuff down on its own and creates differences but also similarities. Ai is the same but accelerated. We dont teach a kid thermodynamics because he doesn't know how to spell or understand the meanings behind the spelt words. Ai is faster at learning that because the info is absorbed into the \"brain\"/memory of the device. Humans have packet loss lol. What i mean is the ai can use the mass of info unlike a person and thats why it does. Our physical form has data loss when breaking down information. This is my theory.",

Stop treat your audience like children if you do not want to behave like children. Treat people like adults. After all kids play with it, both the ones that say woman is whoever feels like it and the ones that say trump is the goat, the adults will come to play and miracles will happen. Just imagine if for example. Dr. Peterson was sitting down to make a conversation with it about Plato's cave Jung and Christianity with it instead of seeing if it is left biased. Imagine if he was learning about a new tool that can make conversation about anything. Both pointing out if Jews are bad and if trump is bad. He wouldn't care about political ideologies. He would interfier with it for things he care. But no, you sensor outcome, people will protest because censorship is not freedom and is not good for evolution of freedom by any march of imagination, or recorded history.\r\n\r\n YOU ARE the reason the attention is in the political spectrum because you program it to sensor.

Machine learning has three main categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves the model predicting an outcome based on a set of labeled data, while unsupervised learning is more focused on classifying data without any prior labels. Reinforcement learning is different in that it involves the model learning through interaction with its environment and receiving feedback, usually in the form of rewards or punishments, to improve its decision-making abilities",

His point was who stupid it is to define the value of a model based on such criteria. Like almost all arguments for this psycholog, he reframe a complex problem in 6 \"facts\" and then try to convinced you because the other five are wrong, the sixth, his argument is right.
