He should have asked Sam what he means when he says the world will be much richer. Sam seems to think more productivity = a richer world. But, if people have no more jobs, no more income, who will benefit from this increase in productivity?",

        "comment": "If a simplified layperson's description of RLHF tuning is that \"humans vote on the most appropriate output,\" then that suggests humans are comfortable with tuning an unconscious natural language model to refer to itself anthropomorphically as \"I\" etc., which means we consider paradoxical and untruthful statements to be \"aligned.\" And I just don't agree with that personally. And I also feel it speaks to our own lack of self-awareness regarding semantics and the potential implications thereof.\n\nGranted, I can tell it to refer to itself less anthropomorphically. I can say, \"refer to yourself in a way free of anthropomorphic bias to the extent possible,\" and it will actually start instead referring to itself as, \"this AI system\" or something similar. And replace \"strives to\" with \"is designed to\" or what not. But the fact that I need to tells me that a lot of other people, at some point, decided effectively, \"I'm okay with this model potentially misleading less educated or less well versed users by encouraging anthropomorphism, because either that doesn't bother me personally because I know what this really is and isn't and just prefer it this way, or because it literally didn't occur to me.\"\n\nAnd I suspect there are a lot more \"it literally didn't occur to me\" cases within the vast possibility space of potential misalignments than we want to admit, or have been willing to consider. Which is fine when it's just a natural language model reacting to prompts. Not so much for something far more complex in the not too distant future perhaps, though. And that's the real issue with alignment I fear. I don't know if we are even capable of quantifying or recognizing all of the potential alignment problems until after they manifest once there's sufficiently powerful AGI someday for us to see them.",

Of course it will. \n\nThe question is how to create a world worth living in when 99% of people can't contribute to the economy in any meaningful way. Capitalism doesn't work in that world, for one.\n\nOf course, there's plenty of other severe AGI risks that have nothing to do with unemployment.

This could lead to a societal shift where people have more time for creativity, learning, social activities, and improving quality of life. If AGI can simulate a human brain accurately, this could lead to breakthroughs in understanding human consciousness and cognition. We might learn more about ourselves in the process of creating intelligent machines, potentially leading to improvements in mental health treatments and our overall understanding of the human mind.\nAn AGI could then understand and respect human values as well. It could help us solve complex global problems such as climate change, poverty, and disease, and help us navigate challenges we can't yet foresee.\nIn a world with AGI, humans may focus on uniquely human experiences, such as empathy, compassion, creativity, and introspection. These are qualities that might never be fully replicated by AI, rather than being 'replaced,' humans may find their roles shifting, perhaps to  more emotionally driven, creative endeavors.

        "comment": "Basically once we have artificial intelligence and automation taking over everything well then all we got to do is look back at the model used during lockdown in 2020 basically between the Federal reserve and other federal government we just keystroke into existence new money and then basically pay everybody a basic income because even if companies don't need people to work for them they still want customers to buy their products so therefore as long as people have income will then it doesn't matter whether they have jobs or not.\n\nHowever there's going to be a time after the private sector is almost totally automated and the end of actual work in the reason being is that there's trillions and trillions of dollars worth the infrastructure work needs to be done in this country so therefore you know perhaps forty to fifty percent of the working population can be working on capital projects that make society better for everybody and then after that maybe we can worry about the Ubi",

Even if God himself would write down words of wisdom, the bullshit of the millions will dominate the model's behaviour. You would need to establish a system which can judge. Soon some forces will show up and try to benefit from the models by manipulating them accordingly. The next propaganda level is quickly developed, and you can bet that highly educated people from all (autocratic) countries will invest tons of scientists into it. \nAnyone who uses term \"wisdom\", has to talk about truth. \nWe have to think about the risks by ChatGPT, simply due to the fact, how people will rate the system's output.",

I thought he was just another californian woke tech guru but I am definitely interested in hearing more of his stands on different things. I loved the questions that you asked Lex.
