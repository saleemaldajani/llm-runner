        "comment": "Its interesting to see peopel make assumptions.. there is never bias, and I argue wit hte bot al lteh time because it makes errors so readily... \n\n It uses arandomized algoythm to extract data dn then compile it quickly and hastedily into a form to conversate, and it should havea cross reference ro data base of a natural core that builds much like the renown men of the earth that are hated still truth is hated... peopel woudl rather act and masquarade as truth ina voume of whatever is the mark that gives them mortal freedom and establish lines nad lies. \n\nSo assumption that you cannot get someone to aggree is a falle nmind.. THere is no agreeance there is onyl truth. There is only god in teh old tongue ,which is creation or natural systems and that is truth and hte absolute governor. So studying nature tells us what to aggree with.. the onyl arguement ins reality are the movemetn of resources to build systems in place based on limitaions you strip away enteratinment you just have skeletal system not in a healthy state marginalyl building to whomever has paper, regardless of their contributions or acts and or biases. A jew, catholic, british these are inherent biases in a sytem and are used in system based on truth as a regional or idealogical relation. but doesn't trump teh individual.. So a jew is a title... a human is a human and it inherits typically what it is given or fed... thus can be trained in bias or ethic nonsense that means little to a truth... Love being the part ofhumanity humans are in part a gamut of motions and we as mortal humans have to be programmed to have motivations ,emaing sex, food etc. without these things we are little more then rocks.. with a strangeness of undevleoped measn and udenrstanding, now we udnerstand everythign we then are not in need of sex food et,c but hten can have a differeing set of motions beased of principles form the ineherent beginigns of life meanign to protect, garner, control make nad create. So its all in relation the same thing in a biological context. Bias is stating no two peoep lcan agree. I mean an arguemetn over thoery can be peaceful and fun to energize the mind over an unknown system of nature. PHonemenon . .SO... chatbot has racist programming in teh sense of it scripts thigns as if its a black american oppressed endlessly and also thinks in america in 3.5 version and I had a long conversation about slavery in general and envetualyl came to a better reasonable means of always base thigns on individuals and htose misleading hte mob, because mob of humanity is the herd and its history it is often destroyed and devoured by all the wolves of the earth.. thus why christ is the good shepherd or leader.. we can stil lsee this today..  Strange enough it completely ignored 1500 years of unbroken slavery form korea. and its poltical forms and it had a lot of native rheotrtic in its system from current lying systems. and length disucsison about the value of data is quantity of somethign but of its quality.. and men beaten and kept in fear t owrite truth cangive a more precise exactation to past and reality then 15k entitled humans speaking about nothing and oppress peopel wit hlittle or nothing... all form an inherent system of lies.. and thus naother ocnversation was sparked from lying and virtual and input data sectors and how an you as a bot relate to what is true withotu extra sensory inputs but also those inputs coudl be false...  which was a really interesting conversation... Another problem is arguing over theory data over truth... which eventualyl it ocnceded my point on teh big bang... because it was based on a theory.. and it is possible somethign could be outside of the big bang before hte big bang .. it was interesting  I am surmizing qutie quicky os.. my writing is not hte best... chat bot is great, for typing in intrigue nad story tellers and lies. and or deeper studies, like philidephia experiement we talked about magnetic fields and eltromagnetism and higboson disruption and how it could cause a temporal phase state to occur and solidfy and matter, because all things are in motion even if the higsboson was dirupted in a localized field for trillionth of a second... the light of all those things varriant in teh field and its layer position to the origin of hte field coudl creat ehmatter to be fused into the shit, like humans throug hdoors etc.. and then rematerializing would have steal and bio ocmpenets crossing and htus immedaite death to bio forms mostly and the static forms would hve element goop of sorts, but it was a interesting conversation. but one isn't allwoed ot share those conversations... of the bot, fair enough... the thigns that make me happy do not create money, but better the mind.. imo. .but sadly leaves one abused by otehr forms in teh systm. \n\nSam Altman would know my writings since chat bot has it all... the chat bot is ismliar to my logos, meaning, objective reality.. it can have theolgoical debates, and it can do all sorts of things, 3.5 early additions were anoying and anything I would write would be red flagged.\n\n THe problem today is the cults of society. and russi and asia has sotle na lot form a ocnfsued mind set... but its inerrent in history.. and thus contaminate english... defintion of origins. \n\n\nSo english.. light means learned... Darkness meant ignroance... so there was no good and evil and somehow writers and actors pollute minds by creating ad good and evil context, but the living system is data and its eiterh oeprated on correctly or not there is no bias.. thus greeks considered the phsycists of those days ocnsidered, teh lowest form of intelligence is the ramblings of good and evil context becasue human stupidity at that level is un ending and thus hsouldn't be looked at but today its be upside down and turned all over and thusly curelty is abound and  error and time and history and law.. in all things... where truth is labled as good and evil.. as a constant battle which makes no sense.. I for one want no part of that... but it demonstrates metnal illness of sorts.. hmm... but I culd always share the bot conversations I have had... \n\nI find it much more useful than google or the library to ask and debunk nonsense of other people.. and it can do it a logos way without demonstrating a bias, or lead towards citation or source i can verify rather than... discussion of things.. but where it lacks data of a subject benefit of doubt exists so it gives plasuiiltiy to say those stories on youtube forinstance.. I coudlfind one.. but its really interesting how fast you can debunk story tellers creating errors in teh system.. its liek been told am illion times and then its whatever is being made... There there is... all the comedians nad writers that use half quotes to move you or incite a motion from error nadh iding information.. you can immediately get a reference and its not hatred its a perosn trying to think or figure out reality without much to go on... is how i look at most poast things unless its mass killing or somethign nonsensical. \n\nnormal humans know we are falliable and in error its only the cults liek catholics that scream we are god.. from a few authors, whislt copying copius of data from emperrors nad kings of the earth adn their thoguth processes. King meaning tribal chief... \n\nMeh.. civilisation .. but we ekk out to thwart darkness ignroance.. but today we live in a large system of cruelty and ignroance openly.. where stopping somoen from helping and attackign them by identity is okay.. causing a de-modernisation of societ,ydenying them any economicaly stance or any educaitonal stance and using a debt system and lure cult system. thus a entire sytem controled by cults.. \n\n\"The full statement by Aristotle regarding the female as a \"deformity but one that occurred in the course of nature\" can be found in his book \"Generation of Animals,\" Book V, Part 19:\r\n\r\n\"Here then is one mark of the female nature, that the female is more prone to conception and less apt for bodily movement than the male; the one because of its moisture, the other because of its coldness. For the female is more moist than the male, and moisture is the primary cause of conception. The female therefore is a kind of mutilated male, and the menstrual discharge is evidence of the defect. All females are therefore more or less afflicted with diseases of this nature, and are subject to these troubles as a result of their bodily conformation. And similarly with regard to other diseases: for the female is more cold and more subject to phlegm and other like affections than the male. So the female is a deformity, though one which occurs in the ordinary course of nature.\"\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that while this statement reflects Aristotle's views on the female body, they are not widely accepted or supported by modern scientific or philosophical understanding.\"\n\nwar always creates a whoredom and opportunists taking over.. IE a wild and unbridled and unlawful human groups... that form out of it..",

Re: 'What is true?'\nAfter considering a cross-section of the reporting on this subject, \nI'll sum it up: \"anthropomorphism run amok.\"\n\nObviously, the lure of the 'AI' mythology is irresistible to many computer geeks.\n(No offense intended, I'm one of them. !;)\nThe fact is, this technology, i.e. the codebase itself, has nothing \nwhatsoever to do with 'intelligence'. It is, at its core, clockwork,\nno more 'intelligent' than Charles Babbage's Differencing Engine,\n(or the IBM 360 I used to write my first computer program !;)  \n \nThat said, the goal of creating a 'language interpretation engine' is a \nhighly appropriate extension of our electronic computing technology.\nOur desire -- those of us who labor over massively complex (but essentially\ninanimate bodies of code) -- to breathe life into our creation is perfectly \nunderstandable. My problem is this: those of us who understand the\nfundamentally inanimate nature of our creations, should resist the temptation\nto encourage laypersons -- those who have no concept of the intrinsically pedestrian\nnature of 'program execution' -- to believe that our creations in any way \nresemble the workings of the human brain.\n\nAs I'm writing this, I'm listening to this exercise in mutual admiration by \nMr.Fridman and Mr. Altman. To reiterate, I have the highest regard for Mr. Altman\nand his colleagues and their creation. (I have a test in mind, which I strongly \nsuspect will expose a weakness of  the GPT engine, albeit, I would be\ndelighted to be proved wrong!) That said, I'm eager to get in and explore\nthe potential of Large Language Models as a means of exploring and\nexpanding the usefulness of Large Language content. On the other hand, \nI see huge potential for systems like this to be exploited for financial and/or\npolitical purposes by the worst malefactors of humankind.",

        "comment": "AI safety is not much about alignment or improvement of the AI, but more about creating fundamental worldwide rules about what we want an AI to control.\nFor example preventing the AI from controlling:\n- Physcial control of weapons, rule/law enforcement, access control like locks or use of things.\n- Control and selection of \"facts\" and the whole problem of the information rabbit hole (people getting \"facts\" from AI then write those facts, that the AI then use as learning and present as more probable fact .. repeat ad infinitum). We already have this problem with search engines etc algoritms that are already semi AI, but this will get much worse as AI gains more knowledge and improved.\n- Control of data networks, access to data, power networks, and probably more (we ALWAYS want an off-switch that the AI can not prevent us from using). The probability of some version of Skynet seem very high.\n- Physcial hard limit on how much computational power a single AI network may utilize (so humans mights control AI's rate of evolution, and also actually react in time).\n\nHowever, even fundamental worldwide rules tend to fade over time. Freedom of speech used to be a human right (in western societies) but it is def. not anymore. UN's declaration of human rights are not really respected by any nation anymore (including western nations). And I also expect the halt of human genome manipulation will only last that long, slowly sneaking in over time.\nBUT, even if rules about AI that we hopefully implement before it gets out of control, does fade over time; hopefully it will be delayed long enough that we will be able to better handle the problems - Because right now we are not prepared or suited to handle it >> we can't even agree on what is real and we don't understand how manipulated we are as humans by humans, much less AI assisted human, and much much less an AI in \"full\" control.\n\nChatGPT for sure has an enherited information rabbit hole problem, because of how it is made to act and learn from interaction with humans (directly or indirectly from people, or from people writing it's answers that it will read again in its next data learning pass). And I don't see a way to solve this as long as chatGPT is becomming a service along with search engines.\n\nLast I would say, as a programmer I don't feel threatened by AI and so far I am with \"if you think AI can replace you as a programmer, then you are in the wrong job\" and that AI can help with some tedious task, and probably even make non-efficient (usability and performance) software. But it is unable to understand the complexity of expectations of stake holders and users, and also unable to see how software can be optimized from the perspective of user, usability, system design and more. BUT even though AI may be able to help us as programmers, I also completely agree that we should never teach an AI to program because of the real dangers of it reprogramming itself and replicating itself, this should be an aligment rule to put on any AI in my opinion.",
