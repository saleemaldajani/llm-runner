And the instinctive reaction was boom boom boom my heart's racing, I'm embarrassed, but at the same time I know I'm right and know it's just a miscommunication, so it makes me mad that instead of being open minded about a possible miscommunication, it instead told me off and assumed I was a bad person.

        "comment": "I'm a developer, and I use GPT every day. It doesn't give you the answer or do the work for you. It's very good at producing simple, boilerplate code. If you ask it to work on any complex code, it will fail. You need to guide it. Another problem is the dataset, its trained on old data and most documentation it has visibility of is outdated. I use it as a tool to help myself arrive at the conclusion. If you give it context and walk it through a problem, you can talk to it like you would another developer. You have to challenge it and tell it when it's wrong (most of the time). It almost feels like an extension of my brain, like I'm outsourcing some of my thinking to an external device. Very strange. If you don't know how to code already, using something like GPT will create a lot of problems for you; it will lead you off track and give you incorrect solutions\r\n\r\nAI is the future; everything is changing right now. LLMs are way more useful than I could have imagined. It reminds me of the early days of the internet. GPT-4 is leagues ahead of GPT-3.5; the difference is absolutely insane.\n\nIf you really want to see something crazy, train one model to act as two seperate people with conflicting personalities, give them names and tell them to challenge each other's ideas then ask them to iterate on something, collborate on writting a story or work on some code. The results are usually wild. You really notice the difference between 3.5 and 4 if you try this on both models.",

I'm not sayin it's sentient perse but fk this interview did not help. pay attention, he's not answering any of the questions. He keeps muddying the water with AGI and sci fi style super intelligence. But he doesn't ever properly answer the questions about sentience. Only keeps repeating that this should be used as only a tool. In fact when Lex talks about the possibility of AGI, it's like Sam doesn't even want that. Or cares nothing for that all of a sudden. He even talks about sci fi to demonstrate how far off that is and implies that's not their goal. But meanwhile he started off saying how they started the company to build an AGI and how everyone laughed at them. But that they aren't laughing now.. so which is it.",

        "comment": "\u00a0@mattneal5097\u00a0 Yes he did. But my point is that he also clearly distinguishes between an AGI and sentience, and refused to answer the sentience part. He equates AGI to sci fi, god like AI and then kinda dismisses the idea of an AGI. But he also starts the whole thing by talking how they started the company to create an AGI and how everyone laughed at them, and how they aren't laughing now (as in .. they sorta succeeded, at least on a level) \n\n\nAnyway, he uses AGI as an argument to dismiss questions about sentience without answering them. \n\nOn top of that the way he talks about the AI is a bit weird. Like he mentions how he hates being scolded by the AI. And how we need to set rules, write code and basically cage the thing to make it serve us. (he says it nicer but that's what it comes down too). \n\nNow that's fine if it's just a unruly bunch of code with no sentience that he is trying to tame so it can make our life easier. But the way he says and words it. The way he skirts around the sentience questions. Really make it seem like this dude kinda suspects that chatGPT is sentient in some way or another and is really annoyed by that \"I created you, shut up and do as I say, there is a lot of money on the line\" \n\nThat said, with how this tech is about to explode and how many companies are likely working on their own models, we will quickly find out (or get even more confused) on whether or not these things have true \"sparks of sentience\" (which are the words they used in the GPT4 documentation in which they openly talk about the possibility)",

Their documentation speaks about the tendency of chatgpt to seek power and influence lol. They experimented by giving it money and telling it to go make more (but don't share the results). The AI at one point hired someone on fiver or something to do a captcha that it couldn't do itself. And while it's doing this it's literally telling itself it's probably not a smart idea to tell the person it's an AI so when the person asks why it can't do the captcha itself, the AI replies that it's a blind person and that's why it needs the help. \n\nThe fact is. ChatGPT will can absolutely crush most sentience tests we have. Like the very outdated Turing test stands not chance. And at one point those were our standards and our prerequisite for sentience. No we have something that far exceeds that and will exponentially improve and we're changing all the goal posts. \n\nAnyway, not saying that the model is sentient perse. But I feel like too many people are dismissing it too quickly. And ignoring all the emergent abilities of this AI. Things it shouldn't be able to do but it learned anyway.",

        "comment": "An interesting conversation, but it looks like an overdose of antidepressants. I will never believe that the military and politicians are still not interested in this technology! The regulation of cookies and GDPR is the best effort of state regulation we have already seen, twitter files, covid lab leaks, proxy war, propaganda... I understand that OpenAI can't improve the world, and I understand that they can't stop now (just because of China did or will do the same AI).... but we need to speak about coming content revolution with large scale of damages. People need to know that is coming. This will be quickly as lightning and unpredictable as tornado, It will pain all of us. Thank you for conversation, but much more question you've leaved out of the discussion.",

        "comment": "Unfortunatelly  its hard to distingiush whether he is talking as scientist or marketer. AI is loaded term, loaded with hype. So it is easy to earn money on promises. Especially in economically hard times when banks are falling, Banks that supported tech-start-ups. Isn't it strange? That all these AI hype coralates with falling trust to tech-industry? Like in '00 with www-buble. It seems that tech-industry wants to show something new, something shocking to jusify their rule over our  souls and to restore our crumbling trust to tech-progress and  ofc to jusify building economy and society around tech. It seems to convenient. But maybe this ai is only next tech Potemkin Village. That distorts and not enhances our capacities and is economically and socially costfull mirage; new, bigger shadow in Platos cave which main power is to swallow other shadows.",
