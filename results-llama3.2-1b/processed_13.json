For example there are tribes around the world that have extensive knowledge of plants, animals, how to survive in hot deserts, dense jungle, freezing tundra, what to forage, how to hunt, how to use various medicinal plants, using their languages near extinction etc ... they used to cover maybe half of the land on Earth and nothing of that experience is in the ChatGPT-4. Hopefully there will be something , before it is too late. They transfer their knowledge and language to their next generations only by word of mouth and direct learning in their natural environment, which is smaller and smaller. Try to gather that information, it will be expensive, because experts needs to go there and sometimes impossible (to not interfere with their living), but it will be worth.",

It was called \"The Richest Family\" and their theory was that ghosts are echoes of the past, and if we look at them that way we could also conclude that seance is a way to conjure the echoes of those who have been captured by the mentalist or channel conjuring knowledge and feelings transmitted from the past, giving them a voice.\n\nSound similar to ChatGPT? Their point was that when we train AI, we capture the knowledge of countless individuals into a \u201cmodel\u201d that can be conjured.\n\nThat leads to the question, Are our modern language models a form of conjuring synthetic ghosts?\n\nThey all seem like pretty smart nerds, that enjoy talking with each other. My biggest crit is that they cover so many topics, they are really interesting topics but digging in a little deeper would be my recommendation.\n\nI think if yous search The Richest Family on Google Podcasts it pops right up.",

        "comment": "Hi there, i really think Sam is honest by saying he does not like to be scolded by A.I.. I had the same feeling when I downloaded the GPT4 app for a free, 4 question try-out. My first question was how to set up a healthy beach bar on Madeira, wow did the bot like me. Then I gave the demand destroy A.I. as a joke, still a profound answer it gave me. Then I changed to 2 other characters. a dog and a blonde perfect one. The dog told me I looked tired, wondering if it could see me, and the blonde mr. perfect told me I was not his type, but could still answer me....that made me wonder if my right of free speech hurted gpt4...not my type....I didn\u00b4t feel good for a sec. And another short point. Living in Japan made me realize something interesting. There are guitar players there that are so perfect, they play better then Jimmy Hendrix, cause of their rational mind, but i rather here some mistakes, to make it real, thats why jimmy was the best. A.I. will never make good music, it will be to perfect.\nAMAZING PODCAST THNX, Jeroen",

It's sad that it won't exist in couple of decades (or maybe years). I believe that people in various fields, including art, engineering, teaching, and scientific research, are worried about their careers too. Do we really want to replace all of those meaningful jobs with AI? Are we prepared?",

Just for fun and if you really want to be paranoid, if you had secretly developed a modest AGI already and you asked it how to best release your product to the world, wouldn\u2019t be a reasonable answer to release in a calculated gradual way? In normal circumstances  these would be  crazy, ungrounded far fetch wonders but I guess that in the context of a project claiming to be so close to achieving AGI, paranoia can be extraordinarily considered a healthy reaction of the general Public",

        "comment": "Hey Uncle Sam. Why does everyone names Sam lately have a negative connotation to their name?\n\nAnyways, this morning, my companies CEO. (Tech company on Fortune 500) announced that there will be massive job cuts effective immediately. Many of my friends and colleagues thought they were going into a normal day of work, possibly feeling a little \u201cfunny\u201d (4/20) only to find out that they have been canned without any warning. That funny feeling I am sure has turned into paranoia and the fear of the unknown.\n\nIt\u2019s not just losing a job, what to do next? \n\nIt\u2019s a merger and acquisition economy. With mostly every large company investing in AGI.\n\nThe only reason I still have a job is because I sell IT to S&L GOV and they have a budget to spend before their fiscal year is over. The employees who got fired immediately are the sellers who cater to Med/Lar,SMB, Healthcare, K-12, High Ed, marketing and advertising departments, HR, middle management, field sales and all of the rest besides the C-Level employees.\n\nOn Hitlers Birthday, this has to happen due to the technology in ChatGPT and the data scanning on a massive scale along with compute.\n\nPlease tell me Uncle Sam? I\u2019m a Capitalist system where competition is the system, it only takes one company to invest in ChatGPT as the future and all else will have to follow in a capitalist system.\n\nThe irony is that everyone was worried about blue collar jobs being weeded out first but this is not the case whatsoever. Blue collar jobs like trucking as a random example which  require safety protocols are going to be the last to fully implement this technology because there is too much liability due to safety precautions and a human will most likely have to be present, at least for the next. 5-7 years.\n\nSo tell me Uncle Sam, when accounting goes out the window, HR, Lawyers, many doctors, Engineers, basically all of the jobs people have taken out massive loans for, what is YOUR SOLUTION, Uncle Sam?\n\nAt this point, I am either a full out libertarian or a Marxist because the technology in ChatGPT 4 and the exponential growth (to say the least) maybe even before ChatGPT 5 is released, will not work in a capitalist system. \n\nWhat is the sole goal of a corporation? To increase profit  quarter after quarter and to raise the stock price for their shareholders. That is it. There is no such thing as a mission statement. All corporations have the same end goal.\n\nJust like a virus, this technology will keep on updating and improving itself at lightning speed and there is no way to put the poison back in the bottle.\n\nI would love to hear someone explain a pro vs. con sheet of this technology (preliminary AGI) because of this is the end, it will be an ugly one of starvation bringing out the absolute worst of people.\n\nSam, you live in your own Utopia. Please remember, AI/ AIG should be a tool and NOT BE OPEN SOURCED. \n\nThe rules of probability by a landslide show that this will end up being a train we cannot stop with no light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nWe are right at the point where we are in the inner ring s of a black hole and have one last chance not to get sucked into the vortex.\n\nThere is no escape.\n\nIf you keep on going, it might be best for humanity if you to go to \u201cBelize\u201d Uncle Sam\u2026",
