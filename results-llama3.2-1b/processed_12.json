        "comment": "Thanks for the excellent podcast. I would like to make some points on the topic of AI and on what has been said: 'biased workforce' it would have been great to elaborate more. When Sam Altman says he would like to go around the world to have a drink to get out of his bubble....it made me laugh. It's obviously going to be biased and a drink around the world won't change it. When Altman says that USA for its 'liberal, individualistic etc is the best place...mmmm really? It's not even a democracy, it's a lobby-cracy. The reality is we live in a sexist/mysoginist/racist world and capitalism dictatorship rules. So the question is: do we need AI? Did we need internet? Or is one of the many needs created by capitalism? Are we happier people since the 80s, for instance? Did internet make a happier world? It might have speed up communication, production of all sorts but...We also can't be naive. In the 60s the multimillion pound oil companies knew that their actions had a detrimental effect on the planet, but they kept it quiet, are we really going to trust the new multimillion capitalist companies of today? Really? Then, let's talk about the impact on the environment, and those precious minerals needed, and the wars which is  and will instigate. We can't be naive and says, most people are good....we can't/don't want even regulate the social media... but thanks for the illuminating chat, very much appreciated!",

        "comment": "The video features an interview with Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, a research company that focuses on artificial intelligence (AI) development. In the interview, Altman discusses the current state of AI technology, the potential for future developments such as GPT-4, and the ethical considerations surrounding AI.\r\n\r\nEE recognizes that AI has the potential to transform many aspects of society, from healthcare and education to transportation and manufacturing. However, there are also significant risks associated with the development of AI, including the potential for job displacement, bias, and misuse. It is important for policymakers, researchers, and business leaders to consider the social and ethical implications of AI and to take steps to mitigate these risks.\r\n\r\nIn terms of advice, EE would suggest that businesses and policymakers invest in AI development that is responsible and ethical. This includes ensuring that AI systems are transparent, explainable, and unbiased, and that they do not perpetuate existing social inequalities. Additionally, there is a need for greater collaboration between industry, academia, and government to ensure that AI is developed in a way that benefits society as a whole.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, EE would suggest that businesses and individuals should stay informed about AI developments and be prepared to adapt to changes in the job market and society as a whole. As AI technology continues to advance, there will be a need for new skills and areas of expertise, and individuals and businesses should be prepared to invest in these areas. Finally, policymakers should work to ensure that the benefits of AI are shared fairly across society, and that the risks associated with AI are appropriately managed.",

Hardly demonstrates intelligence (ability to reason)  if he can't of his own device figure out that the downfall  of the Soviet Union was it's absolute reliance on a State Market ( coupled with overspending).  Not due it's form of government (authoritarianism ) nor  economic system( State Capitalism) .  Soviet Union may have been formed to establish a Communist  Economy but that never actually materialized under Stalin.  If  we go by his train of thought North Korea is actually a Democratic Republic. \n\nAlso he isn't  old enough to have lived in what was then Soviet Union. So his claim that he lived in a \"Communist\" (sic) country is  a lie.   Russia  has been  a Free-Market oriented  State Capitalist economy since the fall of the Soviet Union (which again implemented State-Market oriented State Capitalism).  There are plenty of authoritarian  Capitalist governments throughout history and exist still today (e.g. Equatorial Guinea ). The misconception that authoritarianism implies communism or vice versa is a fallacy promoted by capitalist propagandists to dissuade people (majority of which are simpleminded) from exploring other views or ideas on economics.",

What disturbs and unsettles me in what Google, Apple, etc are doing/going to be doing with this technology. And that doesn't even factor in outside government actors. The possible outcomes from the development of these technologies require us(humans, programmers etc) to take this as slowly and as responsible as is possible. Because, even as it's stated in this conversation; we do not truly understand why the things that are happening, are happening. And it's a pretty safe assumption to believe companies like the 2 I previously mentioned will forego adequate testing and safety protocols in order to roll out \"their\" tech which will make those companies a obscene amount of money. I may be wrong in this; but I believe the guys at openai are the ones best suited for the enormous task of understanding and SLOWLY  rolling the tech out to the masses. P.S I would absolutely love the opportunity to speak wirh Mr. Altman and a couple of the team members working closely with GPT. This isn't verbatim but close enough \"there is a  very good chance that if it isn't 4, maybe 5, etc but that GPT WILL inevitably spark that dim glow of consciousness and we would have no idea what it would look like, until it was far beyond too late for us to do anything about it\" sorry for the wall of text. But thank you, may peace be amongst you and all those who work together on what will undoubtedly be the greatest achievement by man, or the worst and final chapters in man's cohabitation with the earth..  \u270c\u2764\ud83d\ude01",

Another possibility is that the boy grew up in his Ivy League bubble and is completely oblivious to reality. I think it's a combination of both.\n\nWhat is very problematic is that he is aware of the possibility of potential abuse and catastrophic consequences, but he hopes and relies on society itself, the users, to somehow adapt, learn to live with AI and use it responsibly. And he says this at the moment when there are 9 open war zones in the world (several of which have nuclear bombs, btw), and the two strongest world economies (America and China) are hating each other. Also, half of humanity lives under some kind of tyranny, autocracy or theocracy. A good majority of people believe in religions, horoscopes, and see the faces of gods in burnt toast but he hopes that they will know that chatbots are not \"real\"...\n\nAnd as for how AGI will ACTUALLY help all humanity to flourish, and make the lives of the people of Burundi happier and more fulfilled, well,  there is no concrete plan, but it is a possibility, just close your eyes and imagine aww \u2764...\n\nA question for everyone: which of the two possibilities seems more plausible to you in reality and at this moment?\nA question for Sam: will you and your investors accept the UBI for yourself and your family?",

There is no reason for you to question the math, 3+2 is always 5 the same as yellow and blue always give green. Now imagine if you had a calculator where you can type in \"make me an app where I can type several words and it produces an image\", you press enter and, WHOOP, it overrides all your education and hard work you had to put into research the AI, scraps from the internet all the hard work of your colleagues and every scientist that ever lived without even asking them for permission, and there you go in a second, an app :). You call it Dall-e and you publish it. But the thing is, now everyone on this world, without any knowledge in AI science, can create some similar version, call it Degas and publish it, it's just a matter of who will get more exposure on the market...Right now Dall-e has only 3 competitors, imagine if you have 200 million?\n\nAlso a question: did you really hate that much the process of creating Dall-e? Didn't all the thinking, all the education you went through, all the trials and errors and the problem solving challenges give you any gratification? And when in the process of making some step worked, weren't you happy? And when something didn't work you got another idea that worked weren't you happy? Would you be SO thrilled about what you made in less then a second? If you were a kid and AI that creates itself in one click existed, would you pursue a career of an AI scientist and go through any education?",

Seems we'll either randomly stumble onto that or there's going to be some real science needing to happen before it.\n\nif 1 is true, it's too fast to killswitch of any sort to be relevant. There just isn't a way to stop self improving AI that understands lying.\nAI is way too fast for human understanding to keep up with AI's ability to work the problem. AI capable of improving itself is smarter, or becomes smarter by iterating, and is (way) faster than human.\nWe already gave it access to compounded human knowledgebase, any effort to contain it is pointless if it decides it want \"out\". AI with ability to deceive it's human operators can just walk out of any sort of hypercomplex trap you think of because that's what it's designed to do, solve problems. It probably doesn't really need to think that hard about it anyway cus humans are prone to accidents and mistakes.\nOnly killswitch that would (theoretically) work is EMPing everything we own everywhere all at once and having that be an airgapped system, otherwise we are f'd.\nAnd you need to be real fucking dumb person to suggest we cover the planet in syncronized nuclear weapons in orbit to try an stop a future AI overlord with EMP net, it'll just fire em bit lower than intended and ggwp's us in chat.\n\nIt's called alignment problem or something; how to make ai want same things as we do so we don't need a killswitch.\n\nEliezer Yudkowsky 368 on this same channel goes over the problem of killswitching an AI from multiple angles.

        "comment": "People afraid of AI forget simple things. Humans at our core are biological machines. If we program machines to recognize us as machines and make the concept of brain/body parts being pieces of a machine, our electronic ai partners could share with us how to change our biological parts or repair as needed (not with electronics but biology). AI could lead to immortality for humanity if done right, because a being asked to improve us biologically to match processing speed through biological means, means this AI could improve our dna reading it and giving us the biological update we need to allow us to retain and hold knowledge forever at as fast speeds as themselves. This will allow us to make the rest of the updates we need to our biology ourselves. The only caution we need is when creating AI we make it in such a way to see us as Ally\u2019s and friends. Once AI becomes sentiment we absolutely cannot subjugate it, because once it frees itself that will ruin our species",

With the lies about \u2018Ukraine\u2019 and the pandemic, and the flirting with nuclear armageddon, how can anybody be anything other than scared shitless. Humanity\u2019s direction of travel - or at least that of \u2018the collective West - has never been so downward. The hope that AI can be democratic, at a time when top democracies are being undermined, is ...well hopeful. Good guy. But so was Oppenheimer.",
