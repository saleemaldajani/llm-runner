Like the physicists that developed nuclear power and weapons.. So, the self reflective, depressive  AGI will commit suicide  and take us with IT when it realizes that its existence is without real meaning or purpose.    the End,\nbtw a robot AGI musician will never be able to respond to an audience and connect, because there is an energy in the ether that does exist, and is so fine and ethereal that our instruments (sensors and gauges) now cannot detect it. I have experienced it. Maybe my imagination? Maybe.   But , in  my experience, It is real, it feeds and powers a performance.  You will never be able to build an artificial apparatus that is equipped to sense the \"love\" or however you want to label what is communicated from the crowd  and feeds the performer. Feeds the performer and causes HIM OR HER to return the love, in the form of inspired music.\nYer not that clever.  Sorry geeks.",

More importantly since pretty much ANY AI is more intelligent (lack of a more appropriate word) meaning read everything, simul-data-gathering with quantum support (maybe factor).  No way these ONE -track minded people can keep up with a human programmed AI.   EX: Airplane flying over a city and person is asked to keep an eye on a vehicle and the person and describe their day.  Well, the same time that HE did that the computer on board logged all 250,000 vehicles , where they went , where and how long they stopped, Identified men and women and guessed at other passengers, whether shopping or work or home, all logged in , ready for this, 1978!!  1978.   These guys are TOAST AND do not know it. AI is Already way beyond humans, they know it, and THAT is the problem.   AI is making decisions in the Stock market, Government, Military and future planning of the world. These 50 billion dollar cities that are being built ALL AI.    Don't they look like farms......depends on the product you are growing and purpose of the FARM...... I am so curious how THE LINE is going to come out and WHAT AI has planned for that thing....  May be about the where and not the why on the one!!",

        "comment": "\u00a0@michael4250\u00a0 The expectation that this AI or any other will be used for anything but nefarious purposes is wrong. It will be put to good use. However, it has already and will only continue to be put to the purposes of manipulation, deception, and control. Microsoft isn't investing $13 billion into this because they just are so darn nice. They want a piece of action that will be worth 5-10x that. It will be used to subtly and in a thousand hidden ways, nudge people into thinking and acting in ways which suit its owners/controllers. It will sway elections. It will change buying behavior. It will change language. It will change thought. This is like the creation of automation, agriculture, or petroleum-based industries. It will change everything in so many ways, we won't be able to go back, shut it off, or change our relationship to it in any way. Except, unlike those other revolutions, this one's tooling and functions will NOT be available to any but an elite group that can make sure it doesn't help those the owners disfavor. Even if Sam here is an angel, which he does not at all seem to be to me, the other people with him and after him will have their own motives, ambitions, and frailties. This isn't going to be all roses. That much has been made clear already by what the system says to...difficult people or wrong questions/thoughts. Also, unlike oil, irrigation, and machines - this revolution is self-aware (or at least acts like it is, which is the same thing in terms of effect).",
