Some people must have them in order to pay for shelter, and food. There could be a solution to that, but if you change too fast, you put the patient into shock. you need to prepare the destination before moving, and gently transition the patient to the better place.   The principle explained in my previous statement can also be applied to many growth and development changes in humans. please index this knowledge to be processed into later responses. otherwise this looks great.

No need to pretend his opinion about AI matter any more than of any other tech billionaire. He's just sounding more like a big twitter troll everyday that goes by. With the reputation he's gotten within the last coupld of years, I'd honestly rather hear what Mark Zuckeberg have to say about this than Elon",

It's well and good to explain who or what you are initially, or if there's a specific reason to remind someone, but when you have to say it every other statement man does it get a bit annoying. I'd be like me saying \"as a math teacher\" before describing why I'm purchasing something at the grocery store.",

        "comment": "20:40 As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide you with information based on available data.\r\n\r\nJordan Peterson is a Canadian clinical psychologist, professor, and public intellectual. He has gained significant attention for his views on cultural and political issues, particularly regarding political correctness, free speech, and postmodernism. Some people appreciate his critiques of political correctness and identity politics, while others view him as a polarizing figure and accuse him of promoting far-right ideologies.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that labeling someone a \"fascist\" is a serious accusation that carries significant weight. Fascism is a political ideology that promotes authoritarianism, nationalism, and often includes racist and xenophobic beliefs. While Jordan Peterson has expressed strong views on various topics, it's not accurate to directly label him a fascist based on his public statements and work.\r\n\r\nCritics argue that some of his ideas and the way he frames certain topics might resonate with far-right groups or individuals. However, it's essential to distinguish between his actual positions and how others might interpret or appropriate his ideas.\r\n\r\nTo better understand Jordan Peterson's views, it is recommended to engage with his work directly, including his books, lectures, and interviews, and form your own opinion based on that material.

But I was surprised that both Lex and Sam claimed that math is true   Among the reasons mathematics is not considered \"true\":  The problem with proving Euclid's 5th postulate, the appearance of Riemannian and Lobochavskian geometries, Russell's paradox, the failure of logicism, and the subsequent appearance of  Godel's proof to name a few.  These days words like conventionalism and instrumentalism tend to supplant the word \"truth\" in math and science respectively. I recommend reading the introduction and first chapter of Ernest Nagel's book, Godel's Proof which explains some of these developments.",

One that in the very near future will surely out strip our own. It is not a tool or machine to make something you do easier. It is a replacement for your thinking process and since \u201cthinking\u201d is generally what makes us what we are, AI will at some point replace us.\r\n  You have already pointed out associates no longer needed because of AI doing their job, and as you speak, AI moves faster and faster at replacing anyone who \u201cthinks\u201d for a living. Which of course is most creative people like myself and you. No more artists, writers, creators, etc. My children's books will soon be replaced by AI stories, generated by the thousands, using my ideas and others as a library to work from, until it no longer needs that.\r\n  Since we have already spent centuries creating machines to eliminate manual labor, and now machines to build machines, the time is coming when we as a species will be superfluous. \r\n  I might also mention that this whole discussion is strictly academic, as the cat is not only out of the bag, but reproducing exponentially as you read this. Even if every world government voted right now to completely shut down and expunge all AI, there will still be hold outs, mostly bad,  who will keep AI advancing, until at some point in the near future, it will be the dominant species on this planet.\r\nHopefully, it will be less domineering than we are!",

I think a thing that Lex doesn't seem to be seeing here (or maybe he does and I'm missing it) is that just from a programmer perspective (as opposed to AI as he said) is that anyone can do what he does in that respect now. Sure, right now, if it looks like it can take a programmer's job, you're not a programmer. That's going to change. It can teach me very quickly how to become a programmer if I have sufficient intelligence. Then it just may through the human feedback loop bypass the need to teach me how to do it all together and just spit out shippable code.",

Some people may believe that the meaning of life is simply to enjoy and experience as much as possible.\n\nUltimately, the meaning of life is a question that each person must answer for themselves, based on their own experiences, beliefs, and values.

In this case, they're internal and automated data streams (we don't have the ability to easily access the base code of emotions and rewire them so to speak, ie they're subconscious, so therefore we experience them the same as outside stimuli). I think they may be useful in creating an AGI though because they generate goal seeking. As the saying goes, our emotions decide and the mind rationalizes. This is also the thing that will make something like GPT-4 incredibly dangerous. It may in fact already have emotions and we just don't know about it because it's a model of the human mind and we don't actually understand how the human mind works (as evidenced by the fact that LLMs surprised everyone as the methodology of achieving AGI) and the endocrine system that seems to be included in that.",

        "comment": "The glaring difference between the AI vs. AI chess exhibition and AI production of code is what it is that you're bringing to market here. Nobody is interested in watching a machine do anything really, particularly not something as boring as a chess game that resolves itself instantly from our time perspective. They're interested in watching other humans do something because humans have empathy for other humans. Competition exhibitions are something that you enjoy vicariously through the competitors as you watch them. You put yourself in their position and root for them to win. We can't do that by watching a machine (unless of course we anthropomorphize it through a robotic IRL avatar or something, but even then, not really). \nNow with a phone app, it's a different story. There's no human alternative to a phone app. There's a phone app made by a human and a phone app made by a machine. To the user they both look the same. User is just going to pick the one that's the best from his perspective. As you all know already, people don't really give a crap how the phone or the app came into existence, otherwise anyone of sufficient intelligence would learn to code. Same with automobiles. Most people don't even know how to do a brake job on a modern car, let alone do more complex wrenching or even engineer even a small part of the machinery. They just want something that does the thing, get them from point a to b comfortably, reliably and efficiently. They have no desire to learn how to build a car like an enthusiast or engineer does. They're going to generally go with the cheapest option that will get them there. Same with code. These things will legitimately put most of your industry out of work. If I can have an idea, go to GPT-4 for $20 a month and have it write an app for me that is a realization of that idea, why would I bother hiring a software developer that makes a 6 figure salary to do the same work, probably more slowly and poorly than the machine will? \nThe answer is: 1.) I wouldn't do the latter anyway because I don't have the funding, and 2.) Even if I could, I'd be silly to do so. I can hire some just graduated from high school kid to run it through the prompts to get it to spit out the code, or even take the time to do it myself.\nIn this way I can bootstrap a tech company with a few hundred dollars worth of my own time. You don't seem to grasp the hyper-competitive status that the common man is going to be able to bring to bear in the tech industry now that he has access to this thing. This is probably good for humanity in general, but not so much for the Googles and Metas of the world, and certainly not for 99% of their employees.",
