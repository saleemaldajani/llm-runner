Every answer from these tech people about the possible dangers of what they're doing and the unimaginable scope of societal displacement that is sure to follow goes something like: \"Yeah but what if we cure cancer with AI. Oh but imagine how much more time people will have. Our lives will be so much better.\" And then when pressed about specifics they default to \"Oh, I don't know but imagine!\". The truth of the matter is, the system is set up in such a way that the people who will have access to this technology will be the people with resources today. AI will be used to further maximize gains in investments. It'll be used to fight wars. And the most you'll see of it is some highly interactive porn. Oh and maybe your smartphone camera becomes better. You still won't be able to afford a house, you still won't be able to afford a family, and you still will work the same amount of hours. And while this will create a handful of new billionaires and maybe our first trillionaire one fact remains the same: you get nothing.",

C-GPT/Bard/Midjourney etc are commercial services not a random person, so they can't be using other people's IP freely as that breaks laws in literally every country. It's very obvious that they are trained on content protected by IP has you can literally ask C-GPT to give you the content of most books word-per-word ( is this any different from publicizing a pirating service? I can make a bot in a few minutes that gives me the full content of any book using their API ) \n\nHow will society adapt to this? is IP a thing of the past? ( seems very tech-bro utopian). Are these bots going to have to publicize the dataset and let individuals remove protected information from the training data? What happens with content that you used chatGPT to generate? Can you copyright it if it generated it first for you?\n\nIt's trained on publicly available data in the internet yes, but usually you can't just grab somebody else's content and have your commercial service spit it out as most of that is ownership of the other person. Google gets away with it because they don't actually give you any copyrighted content, they point to other people that give you the content.\n\n A lot of the value of these generative AI's come from now having free-reign to use pretty much anything on the internet with no consequences.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Likely considered already, but why not have rater be a separate AI machine that learns that job, and human input is provided to that, but takes into account demographics (just some basic criteria), and those humans actually rate the 'rater AI' decisions but not binary, instead based on a spectrum.\nExample: AI rater decides 1 of 3 possible responses is best, humans grade those but on a spectrum (e.g. rate 1 to 5...best, better, acceptable, somewhat unacceptable, unacceptable). This would also be a way to build demographics-based personalization models.\n\nBasically: I can see the trouble/difficulty with human input bias, so create one more layer between humans, still 'informed' by humans but creates a degree of separation. And grading on a spectrum reduces the impact of even a pocket of hard bias.",

I found programming as a puzzle.  Something to keep me and my mind busy.  I am not a great programmer.  Nor do I believe I ever will ever be in terms of a typical software developer.  I thought that I might be able to find a job that required some level of programming but not enough to require me to be a full fledged software developer.  Now, what I thought could be a step forward to find a new purpose in life is probably going to be replaced by a LLM.  Now, basic programming abilities is there for people who never put in the effort to learn.  I am not confident many people will have a purpose anymore once businesses integrate LLM into their businesses, but I am hoping I am wrong.",

That\u2019s actually a smaller issue than the problem of alignment. I see no reason to believe humans would be better than AI at alignment with those without enormous power.",

It is also better to start early so we have more time rather than have the whole thing drop on us suddenly. BUT I hate how he dismissed GPT - n as a tool. I wish Lex pushed deeper and asked him exactly what it would take to see the model as an \"it\". Does sam understand? just like humans, these models also have a world model, a microcosm of the universe inscribed inside it. It can pick actions, reason, pursue goals. If not current models, it is getting there. Calling it a tool is dangerous.",
