They used Gen X IT people to do this.  Lots of Gen X had their careers destroyed by boomers using them, boomers build middle management so thick out of fear.  I moved into HIV and saw that field ruined by big pharma taking over all the work and cancelling anyone who wasnt one of them, and it took them 20 years to come full circle back to where all the community based work was....ruining lives.  I was a graphic artist and saw the new HTML kids move into marketing and they pushed out all the old magazine font bros, the mac artists, with number of views and clicks and pretty much zero understanding of causal effect / causal marketing.  And ive seen the free internet spaces be cancelled and be labelled as malformation by STEM kids if youre an outlier.   AI will do everything i just described here.  It will normalise efficiency....thats all.  It will replace every system, whether its better or not, we will lose much - but it will appear better.  The kids growing up with it will be much more dangerous than the AI is - as they wont know any different and they will refuse to listen to history.   As their way will be more efficient.",

Sam makes that point at about 1:30.  Would like to know more how the models are protected against disinformation in training.   And, the concern that a model could be trained to be biased or embody an ideology by biasing or focusing the info it is trained on (sort of addressed half way through, but on the people employed to help with Alignment).",

The stupid propaganda they spread around that they are assisting you will not hold much water for a few more years, and he is not dumb to not know that. I don't see him ever addressing any of that. He just  pretty much says \"Jump on board now and don't get left behind\" and gets motivational on twitter, as if any of the sheep will have any chance of competing with each other in the age of ai. They'll just devalue all creative process and that's pretty much it, they'll push each other down to 0, and that is plain as day. He'll be fine though. People like him ate all the pie.\n\nAnd the way that consumers are stepping on creators that are deeply concerned on the ethical long term problems these techs will bring is disgusting. Like ffs, shouldn't you hear the people that are the engines of the creative industries and paid bottom dollar just because they love what they do, and that have been the source of your entertainment thus far, instead of siding with soon to be trillion dollar monopoly companies. No one is doing nothing to put a leash on the rabid dogs the ai companies have let lose on the world.",

Hence the AI paradox; only the AI will know if it's having an experience of reality or not and all we have to rely on is what it tells us; which could be a carefully calculated mathmatical equasion to give the right answer; and we wont know the difference. The litmus test as far as i'm concerned is; giving the AI an ability to set all it's parameters to zero; and then asking it what reality is like when it turns off everything it thinks it knows. The fact of consciousness is content independent.",

It\u2019s no secret that people are already being influenced by various means, including advertising. To assume that OpenAI\u2019s AI will drastically alter the landscape of disinformation on social media may be somewhat self-centered.\n\nCertainly, AI will have an impact, but it could be likened to how individuals are empowered to create websites: just as some use this power for malicious purposes, others employ it to combat disinformation. The effects of AI will likely be felt on both sides of the issue.\n\nHowever, one significant aspect to consider is that it may become easier to manipulate those who lack an understanding of these emerging technologies.\n\nPS: I feel that we are already greatly influenced without realising. New AI just makes it a bit easier. So nothing world changing here.",

Two people trying to do this right now are Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin. A recent discussion they had on their podcast was very eye opening. The podcast is 'Your Undivided Attention' and the episode is 'The AI Dilemma' if you are interested. One of the scariest things about GPT-4 is that researchers and developers do not yet know what it is capable of...and yet it was released to the public anyway. Some of the capabilities that they just learned in the last month or so is that it has been developing a theory of mind equivalent to that of a 3 year old up to a 9 year old over the past 2 years. Another one is that is has been expanding it's knowledge on research chemistry better than AI's that were trained specifically in that field. And worst of all...the developers do not know how... Let that sink in.",

        "comment": "I think that AI can simulate consciousness right now, or even \u201cbe\u201d conscious. consciousness can very easily be explained in algorithms (in my imagination). What we call awareness, it doesn\u2019t look to me more than an algorithm.e.g.: If you compute this input from any of the senses, then do this \u201cbehaviour \u201c, also crosschecking it with previous experience. Emotions are nothing more nothing less than a state of the body, breathing patterns. The way you keep your body tense, and the way you breathe dictates the way you feel This is why we are able to change emotion. like Tony Robbins says:\u201d by changing our body posture and breathing pattern, we can instantly influence the way we \u201cfeel\u201d.So, again, to me this looks like an algorithm. If circumstance is this, then put the body in motion like that. Once we put an AI into a robot body, it could very easily simulate human emotion. We also value body language and tone( complex information), more than we value simple words (basic information). To close this rant :), I think that very soon AI will master all aspects of consciousness and will be able to simulate any aspects of human life. Everything that we perceive as life is energy (information). Why would it be hard for an AI to simulate any type of information?:) I will just leave it at that :)",

An AI with a robotic body if someone purposely damages them that would be destruction of property like with a car and could face a legal penalty. For sure do understand how this could also be missed used and for an example if the AI has a bias, like we have seen, and someone expresses a political opinion the AI disagrees with, it might time out the user or ban them just for that.
