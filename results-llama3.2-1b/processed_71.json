        "comment": "GPTs information on topics like the lab leak cuts off in 2021, does it not? Hopefully, one day soon, it will be up to the minute with its information. I also question its reasoning abilities at this time\u2026 the lab leak is a good one for me, because I\u2019m not religious about it.\u2026 But, there were a lot of deleted emails, attacks on people who asked questions, and other things that cast suspicion on one side..With no evidence on the other side to justify that. Which makes me lean in a direction with my assumptions. To say it\u2019s equally either side lacks insight - if that\u2019s what it\u2019s saying. I wonder if it knows how to consider these suspicious activities, and what they imply. Not here to debate the lab leak, just the reasoning skills of this particular version of GPT.\n(Would add this- it was an uphill battle, that could mean the loss of your friends and career, to assert one of those arguments above. Can it understand that one side is towing the line and to take the other side comes at great risk - and you don\u2019t just do that for fun, etc etc. things to take into consideration).",

        "comment": "On the subject of whether GPT4 is conscious, I think the interviewer here has the wrong idea.   AI experts are not dismissive of the possibility that GPT4 can exhibit consciousness simply because it is a computer program and are dismissing it out of hand without regard for the evidence.\n\nThe reason that we can conclude that GPT4 is not an AGI is because while we may not know exactly how our own brains work, for instance, we can still have a very high confidence in ways that our brain does NOT work.\n\nIt may very well be that some future iteration of the GPT model might be capable of producing output that is entirely indistinguishable from that which a conscious mind could produce, but that would not make it conscious.  Not because it is just a computer program, but because of how that computer program actually works, and the fact we can have a VERY high degree of certainty that our own minds do not actually work that way.  The GPT model works simply by selecting random tokens based on their frequency in the training text, and biased according to how often then appear in the context of tokens it has seen so far.   Essentially, all that the GPT model does, of how much you scale it up, is randomly babble.  Normal natural language communication does not work this way.   That is how we can actually confidently know that it is not intelligent.   ChatGPT only appears to be so coherent because it has a very large context window for its token production, and because so much meaning in natural language comes from context.   The GPT model has no innate understanding either of anything that is said to it or anything that it says.  Because understanding something is not simply derived from the frequency with which you have encountered particular linguistic tokens.  In fact, there's no real evidence to suggest that understanding is  intrinsically bound to language at all, even though language may be required to communicate it.  So ultimately,  no iteration of the GPT model cannot ever really be intelligent,.\n\nIt may be a stepping stone on the journey to AGI, but it's only a stepping stone.  It's not going to actually get us there.",

As I understand it, feedback loops allow a being to take in information/stimulus and process/study it both unconsciously and consciously continuously. It needs a memory because a conscious being needs to have a point of reference for a sustained sense of self. Lastly, it needs agency to be able to probe its own sense of self and consciousness. I also have no background in psychology or artificial intelligence so I could totally be wrong. This is just my own take. I'd love to hear someone else's thoughts",

While with a good ol' job you can simply quit and find another one if you find the terms disagreeable. If there are significantly less jobs available many people will rely on obeying the government. This can include things like having to live in a particular area, or in a particular type/size of apartment/dwelling, or take certain vaccines...\n\nPeople who have less mistrust in their governments will naturally think working less (with government redistributing wealth) is a good thing while those who have more distrust will not.",

Neural Network to consume and transform data into the database - graph\n2. answering and reasoning agent - can interface with the graph and with questions from the outside\n3. Questioning agent wich can ask specific questions based on the graph and challenge the 2nd (answering and reasoning) to improve the database - graph",

It sounds like an extremely loaded answer implying trying to (blank). Are we searching for ourselves in there? Are we trying to find more accurate ontological ideas thought to be out of the realm of proving scientifically? Or is he implying something like we\u2019re gonna prove this is all a simulation come hell or high water? Sam said it himself earlier in the interview, and was refreshingly honest about the fact that tech bro dismissiveness of ancient ideas of the physical world and it\u2019s role in a larger framework is now pivoting to simulation theory, which when approached honestly is really just moving the goal posts back on classic theological ideas. The simulation theory is just video game jargon on the old school war in heaven idea of abrahamic faiths. It\u2019s literally indistinguishable from each other but public figures like Musk seem to think somehow it\u2019s not. Classic theology is very dark, and posits transcendent worlds using this world as an entertainment like device, or a device to keep certain power structures in place, all ideas as old as humanity. So if we can peek behind the screen, and screen and discern a greater physical truth what will that do to the collective mind of humanity. We have failed the young the last 30 years, joining them in mocking the angels and gods of yesteryear, and failed to teach them a higher resolution framework to make sense of our place in the cosmic scheme. It\u2019s time we atone for that failure, and stop using existential agnosticism as a default hand waive, and start instilling virtuous values like justice, respect, and fairness in our offspring. What Musk is doing with his platform is dangerous, piling onto the childish crusade against wokeness is absurd and harmful for someone with his influence to peddle. It reeks of South African daddy issues to heaven. Same with people like Peter Theil and the entire rest of longtermism true believer crowd. I like Sam\u2019s what seems to be more mature stance on the issue of AI bias and our responsibility to mold these models into ideal versions of the ethical and moral ideal of humanity. If that doesn\u2019t always align with purist market ideals and anarchic speech ideals so be it. Whenever some extremist try\u2019s to tar and feather the social justice crowd, scratch your head and ask them if it\u2019s all justice they oppose? Or just the social kind? Because the two don\u2019t seem to be separable. It\u2019s not our fault that our machines need to point that out to the sociopaths that want to weaponize language and subjugate their fellow humans.",

And as the number of server/nodes multiply exponentially, Governments/Authoritarian regimes will have their own AI systems and as the competition grows nobody will want to pull the plug. I think, either we will become a very civilized society ourselves or will be tamed into one to save the world. New type of race has begun and nobody knows how to wargame the situation. Maybe by that time, Elon Musk comes up with working Neuralink and we can again be in driver's seat. Just thinking. What a time to live in.",
