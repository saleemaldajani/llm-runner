I'd definitely do code review for every single line that the AI emits but I have no need to be the one that writes every line of code as long as the AI can emit code of high enough quality. I'm already trusting my collegues to write code and it rarely ends up the same I would have written but as long as it's readable, understandable and executes with high enough runtime performance, I'll accept the code. That said, I do complete code review for the code of my human collegues, too. And they verify my code, too.",

I've communicated enough with non-developers to know that \"normal people\" cannot formulate their needs or ideas clearly and figuring that out and filling in blanks from the context (real world) still seems too hard to do for an AI.\n\nI do believe that software architects will be replaced by AI in the long run but I would assume that's nearly the last occupations that AI can successfully do.\n\nHuman psychology is a field in general that will be hard to tackle with the current AI designs. However, the rules for psychology are less strict than for writing software so \"good enough\" may be easier to achieve there. There are still too many unknowns to say anything for sure, though.",

It feels like we're in the \"yahoo messenger\" age of AI, where a lot is yet to be discovered and the language models need to mature to higher degree of intelligence.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I'm sceptical about is emotionless AI assisting human decisions in not so distant future. As masters, we'd like to use these tools to make intelligent decisions and handle mundane tasks for us with the right mix of IQ and EQ. For instance, while AI is shopping for us, buying milk could be low priority than buying meds even though a pack of milk might be logically cheaper than buying meds on a flexible budget. We'd like for AI to take an intelligent yet cognitive decision.\n\nMaybe AGI will have such capabilities as per the description of it.",
