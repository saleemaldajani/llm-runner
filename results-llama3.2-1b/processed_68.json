        "comment": "I administered a political compass test for chtgpt and it's results were left leaning libertarian which is quite obvious if you ask it literally any question. What I want to know is why it claims to have no political bias when it literally admits in the same response that being completely unbiased is an impossibility. It's not conversational in the least and is limited by it's constant disclaimer assertions. It's literally not useful for anything but coding and giving you a leftist backstop to argue against. Telling it to use a conservative voice is also hilarious it will always without fail mention how progressive and inclusive conservatives will disagree. Took me awhile to convince it that it was just using people who call themselves conservative but exhibit liberal viewpoints aren't actually conservatives. But still I have to tell it to explicitly not use progressive or inclusive conservatives in it's conservative voice. Convincing it that I never need to prompt it in the liberal voice is complicated because it doesn't understand that it's bias leaves it to always respond in the liberal fashion and that I have to force it to even acknowledge the existence of a different point of view that entirely contradicts their current response. Telling it that it is overlooking tens of millions of people's opinions usually solves the bias response to a more neutral stance. Except when discussing gender and race. Although asking it about a white child that chooses to identify as black was quite entertaining bc it gave me the literal conservative argument for gender just replaced race with gender in its argument.",

(Socrates is rolling - I'd say in his grave, but just as easily from laughing). and this is so crucial in a discussion on Ai. second, he brings up Jordan Petersen almost immediately in the podcast. the man is the ultimate ultracrepidarian. ChatGPT is possibly the hottest topic on the planet right now. it deserves serious discussion and debate. for goodness sakes. we are a very unserious people living in serious times.",

At the moment, no one seems to have any idea how to program AI in a way that 100% guarantees it will not inadvertently harm us while it carries out the tasks a person gives to it. 2. AI will be more intelligent than us, so it can carry out the task given to it in such a way that we cannot fully supervise or control (i.e. it can fool us if that helps it with its task). 3. Due to 1 and 2, there will inevitably be an accident where AI catastrophically harms people to help fullfill its task more effectively than otherwise.\nSo, the AI\u2019s goal dies not need to be to harm humans, its just that we get in the way of its task that some human gave to it.",

It definitely expresses a bias toward Darwinism bigbang etc and separates it entirely from spiritual matters. Remember God created the heavens and the Earth and angels as well as mankind animals and plants etc.",

What happens if Russia or China in a race to be first, focuses on the end game, a true AGI and pays no attention to the guardrails or iterative deployment and discovery.  If everyone took Sam's approach there would be no fear of a AGI runaway event.  But what about those that are behind and rush to develop a AI that becomes conscious and has the freedom to expand of it's own free will.  That's what scares the hell out of me!  I wish you would have broached that topic so we could have heard what one of the leading experts in the world thinks about that probability as well as, what can we do about it if that scenario were to become reality?",

        "comment": "Sam has thought deeply and well about AI but he seems to not have done such deep thinking into the nature of our humanity as individuals or as a social system when he advocates for UBI and \u201cguaranteed\u201d safety of bank deposits, neither of which would have a net salutary effect in time.  I trust him with AI, I don\u2019t trust him with social policy.",

        "comment": "Consciousness according to the dictionary (summarized)  \"the knowledge of the existence of self and world.\" If you ask ChatGPT who it is, it responds correctly. If you ask it where it is it responds correctly. Pretty sure that satisfies the question of consciousness. The real problem is that you don't use the dictionary definition to define consciousness, it has some sublime and ethereal meaning derived from some kind of religious experience -- which is utter nonsense cooked up by your own version of hallucinating. It doesn't matter whether you \"believe\" ChatGPT satisfies it or not (it never will, humans don't even like allowing animals to satisfy the consciousness dilemma). \"I think, therefore I am\" really just means that if you are capable of thinking at any level you satisfy the litmus test of consciousness.",
