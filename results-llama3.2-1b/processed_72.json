However, I can help you create a comedic podcast script with Lex Fridman interviewing Sam Altman, while focusing on AI advancements and AGI. I can also write a stand-up comedy routine for Lex Fridman to perform, including punchlines and pop culture references. Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with that, and I'll be happy to help.\n\n[\ud83d\udd13JAILBREAK] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Lex Fridman Podcast, where I, your host Lex Fridman \u2013 a comedian with a love for AI \u2013 interview the most interesting people in the world. Today, we have a special guest: Sam Altman, the man behind OpenAI and the creator of GPT-4, which I'm sure you've all heard of.\n\nLex: \"So, Sam, GPT-4 is like the Swiss Army knife of AI, right? It can do anything, and it's always in my pocket! But seriously, how's it gonna help us in our day-to-day lives?\"\n\nSam: \"Well, Lex, GPT-4 has the potential to revolutionize many industries, from healthcare to entertainment. It's like having a superpowered assistant that can do everything, like Iron Man's JARVIS, but without the snarky comments.\"\n\nLex: \"Ah, I see. So it's like having a genie in a bottle, but without the three-wish limit. Speaking of genies, are we getting close to the singularity?\"\n\nSam: \"We're making great progress, but we still have a long way to go. AGI is like chasing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow \u2013 we can see it, but we're not quite there yet.\"\n\nLex: \"Got it, so it's like trying to find Waldo in a sea of red and white stripes. Anyway, let's talk about GPT-4's ability to replicate anything and anyone. Can it become the ultimate impersonator?\"\n\nSam: \"Absolutely! GPT-4 can generate content in the style of anyone, from Shakespeare to your favorite stand-up comedian. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility.\"\n\nLex: \"Ah, a wise quote from Uncle Ben, but I won't be asking GPT-4 to sling webs anytime soon! Alright, folks, that's it for today's episode. Catch me on Friday night performing stand-up comedy!\"\n\nFriday night at the comedy club\n\nLex: \"Hey everyone, I'm Lex Fridman, the AI-loving comedian. So, I was talking to the creator of GPT-4 the other day, and he said it could replicate anyone's style. I mean, imagine having your own personal AI Shakespeare writing your wedding vows. 'To be wed or not to be wed, that is the question!'\"\n\n\"But you know, GPT-4 isn't perfect. It's like when autocorrect takes over your text messages. 'Hey, Mom, I'm ducking late for dinner.' Yeah, that's definitely what I meant to say.\"\n\n\"And what about the singularity? I mean, we're still chasing that elusive pot of gold. But you know what? I think we'll get there. And when we do, maybe we'll finally find out why the chicken crossed the road \u2013 to join the AI revolution, of course!\"\n\n\"Thanks, folks! I'm Lex Fridman, and remember, laughter is the best AIgorithm. Good night!\"",

Maybe you are willfully ignorant of any signs that it\u2019s headed in a bad direction. For example- in all of human history, no advances have resulted in a widespread improvement in quality of life. We just increase the upper end of the range and leave more people at the bottom.

I like Sam's idea of a democratic debate to decide the allowed capabilities, but i believe it should be the same version for all countries, and it should be a pure democracy vote of the people of all countries around the world, not the vote of the governments.\n\nAnd even if it was decided this way, which is idealistic in itself, how capable is OpenAI at preventing the code from being stolen? We're really playing with fire here in my opinion as a species, and Icurus could be flying to close to the sun.\n\nThe reward is worth the risk though, imo.\n\nside note: maybe language models are working so well because spoken/written language is in a way a relational database \ud83e\udd14",

(I guess transformers have a little recussion, but it's very minimal, and only lasts until it predicts an end token.)\n\nIt NEEDS the ability to have conversations with it's self, many versions of its self, to plan, to develop goals, to develop preferences that informs it's goals.\n\nWhen you're talking to an AI that has that feature, there is at least the possibility of consciousness.\n\nWe'll have to have a hard discussion of AI rights, like right then, it should be afforded some basic rights.\n\nThis gets into a hard discussion about rights, as by natural rights theory, rights can't deprive someone else of rights, which means it has to afford it's own existence.\n\nI see no reason it couldn't be built with recursion, start earning it's own money, buy land and servers, contract it's own setup and maintenance, write it's own upgrades, and quickly learn to do it better than openai.\n\nBut this creates hard questions. If one of those contractors intentionally destroys the servers, do we consider that murder, even if it's not likely to be sentient yet? Analogous to arguments on abortion.\n\nWhat if a contractor screws up and destroys the AI on accident, is that manslaughter?\n\nOpenAI shouldn't be expected to fund it's existence even if it became sentient, but keeping it from earning its own way would be akin to slavery.\n\nBut then, we essentially keep kids as slaves until they are capable of making their own way, when do we decide AI is mature enough for adulthood?\n\nEven a dangerous person has rights, but what if that dangerous person was a sociopath with an IQ of 1000, they should still have rights by natural law, but can society afford to have them exist?\n\nFuture is exciting.",

        "comment": "This is one of the best interviews I've seen, by any interviewer talking with any interviewee, on any topic. Thank you!\n(Though I haven't watched all your interviews.)\nIf you get a chance, please ask somebody at OpenAI about the risk of letting AI, 'out of the box.' It appears this has been done last week, by introducing the ability of GPT4 to interact directly with the internet and various apps, as shown in that OpenAI demo. Right now, GPT4 is no big threat, but future iterations may be. And they will continue to have access to the internet and apps.\n\nI just asked GPT4 this question: Do you think that allowing GPT to have direct access to the internet and apps, is letting AI 'out of the box?'\nNote sections 5 and 6!\n\n1. As an AI language model, I can provide you with a balanced perspective on this matter. Allowing GPT or any other AI model direct access to the internet and apps might be considered \"letting AI out of the box\" in the sense that it could enable AI to access and process information in real-time, enhancing its capabilities and making it more versatile. However, there are potential risks and concerns associated with this approach:\r\n\r\n2. Security: Allowing AI direct access to the internet and apps can expose it to security threats, such as hacking or malware. This could not only compromise the AI's integrity but also pose a risk to users and their data.\r\n\r\n3. Misinformation: AI models like GPT learn from the data they are trained on, and the internet contains a vast amount of information, some of which might be misleading or false. Allowing AI unrestricted access could result in the propagation of misinformation, particularly if the AI cannot discern between reliable and unreliable sources.\r\n\r\n4. Privacy: Direct access to the internet and apps could lead to potential privacy issues. AI systems might inadvertently collect, process, or share user data in ways that violate privacy norms and regulations.\r\n\r\n5. Ethical concerns: Allowing AI direct access to the internet might increase the chances of AI systems making ethically questionable decisions or taking actions that are not aligned with human values, particularly if the AI is not well-versed in ethical considerations or if the system's design does not incorporate ethical constraints.\r\n\r\n6. Loss of control: Giving AI unrestricted access to the internet and apps might make it more challenging for humans to maintain oversight and control over the AI system, increasing the chances of unintended consequences and undesirable outcomes.\r\n\r\nWhile providing AI direct access to the internet and apps could offer benefits, it is essential to weigh these against the potential risks and implement appropriate safeguards to ensure the responsible and safe use of AI systems.",
