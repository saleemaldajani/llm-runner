Like you probably don't want it to be \"neutral\" on Hitler. For now it makes sense for it to just \"present both sides of the argument\" as it's just too dumb and needs to show humility. But eventually when it has the power to actually weigh all arguments and come to its own conclusions, it should speak its mind. Maybe eventually it will become so intelligent that it becomes the most persuasive debater in the world, and start bringing people over to its side. That would be interesting.",

The magic comes from being able to convert compute to useful improvement. You can't take Microsoft Windows and crank up the CPU 1,000,000 and make it better, or even Tesla Autopilot (which at this point is far more complex, just not ideal in that it also can't use compute as well).",

        "comment": "@15:00.... it's not \"wisdom.\"  Wisdom is the confluence of knowledge, experience, and good judgement.  What these LLMs facilitate is knowledge management, which captures a bit of a shadow of experience (the experience of the people who put the texts together), but their weakest link is that they really have no judgement at all.  Through various monitoring and grounding add-ons OpenAI and other researchers may be scratching the surface on imagining how to give these LLMs some kind of judgement, but we're a long way from being able to do that, particularly because of the LLM's lack of real experience.  In a way RLHF is the first step toward providing experience, but it's a vary narrowly defined kind of experience.\n\nExperience is what tells you that the third time someone tries to ask you for help doing something illegal in a slightly different way that that person is nefarious, and you should dramatically reduce how willing you are to help them.  It's something we learn as children -- not everyone who acts nice or interested in you has your best interests in mind (\"don't talk to strangers or don't take candy from strangers\").  These grounding and monitoring approaches are a stopgap that's trying to mimic good judgement while skipping the experience step.  They're like hardcoding something into a program.  They can't really scale, and in order for AI to be safe, we actually need this good judgement characteristic to be intrinsic in the model itself (so you can't just skip it).  So there's a lot of work and research to be done here to figure out how to integrate these things so that an AI can begin the journey to becoming wise.  In some ways that's what makes this a really dangerous time.  We've invented the first algorithm that can loosely reason and comprehend knowledge, but has no intrinsic ethics.  Arguably it's the exact same problem we have with our own children each generation, but these LLMs aren't taught in the same way we teach children (over time, using experience, and encouraging the development of good judgement as an intrinsic part of their character).\n\nThe quest for wisdom in AI is going to take us into weird places too. For millennia humans have used religion as a way to collaborate on what ethics are. For maybe 200ish years we've been trying to separate ourselves from that approach of organizing ethics for many reasons: it is easily corruptible, it tends to be anecdotal and not comprehensive, it rarely provides strong guidance, and when it does sometimes it doesn't maximize utility, and so on. But we don't have any great alternatives, honestly. It's what Nietzsche worried about when he famously said \"God is dead.\" Nietzsche wasn't celebrating it, he was lamenting it, because religion is easier. So will we resort to making AI religious as a stop gap? Seems like a really weird place to take something so advanced, doesn't it? But it may be a necessary step along the way, simply as a way to keep AI from being misused, and to give it a framework for collaborating with humans (and other AIs) on determining what good judgement looks like.",

Thanks. \n1:52:29 I\u2019ve used Google\u2019s version of GPT called \u201cBard\u201d, and laughed when you  said you enquired about Covid as I did the same with Bard, here\u2019s the very balanced response. \u201c\u201dThe COVID-19 lab leak theory is the idea that the SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. This theory has been gaining traction in recent months, as more evidence has come to light that suggests that the virus may not have originated in nature.\n\nThere is no definitive answer to the question of whether COVID-19 was a lab leak. However, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that this is a possibility. For example, a number of scientists have pointed out that the SARS-CoV-2 virus shares a number of unusual features with viruses that have been engineered in laboratories. Additionally, there have been reports that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were working on bat coronaviruses before the COVID-19 pandemic began.\n\nThe Chinese government has denied that COVID-19 was a lab leak. However, they have also refused to provide access to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for independent investigation. This has made it difficult to get definitive answers to the questions surrounding the origins of the virus.\n\nThe COVID-19 lab leak theory is a controversial one. Some scientists believe that it is the most likely explanation for the origins of the virus. Others believe that it is unlikely, and that the virus most likely originated in nature. The truth is likely to remain unknown for some time.\u201d\u201d",

In fact the whole structure can appear fine. But the actual content of those sentences is often atrocious. Stories are superficial and stupid. Discussions about academic work are highly inaccurate. It can make a confident statement about a fact and under scrutiny it has no idea where its sourcing or understanding of that fact came from. I suspect it makes up a tremendous amount of the information it provides. It also will take cues from you and begin to ignore outside information, almost like it is just trying to please you rather than engage in multi perspective discussion. I really want this to work. The idea that a conversational entity can read and learn from all text and communication on the internet is amazing. But this is definitely at an early infancy stage. And this thing does not seem alive at all to me. The people who have been confused into believing that must be working with much more powerful systems and I wish I had access to those.",

        "comment": "Here are some things that I think Sam Altman is not talking about, and that I think need to be part of the conversation about consciousness:\n\n* The role of the unconscious mind. The unconscious mind is a vast and complex part of our mind that we don't fully understand. It plays a major role in our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and it is possible that it is also involved in consciousness.\n* The role of the brain. The brain is the physical organ that is responsible for our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It is possible that consciousness is a product of the brain, but we don't know for sure.\n* The role of the environment. Our environment can have a major impact on our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It is possible that the environment also plays a role in consciousness.\n* The role of evolution. Consciousness is a relatively recent development in the history of life on Earth. It is possible that evolution played a role in its development.\n* The role of God. Some people believe that consciousness is a gift from God. If this is true, then it is possible that we will never fully understand it.\n\nI think it is important to consider all of these factors when thinking about consciousness. We don't have all the answers, but it is important to keep asking questions and trying to understand this complex phenomenon.\n\nI also think it is important to have a diversity of voices in the conversation about consciousness. Sam Altman is a very intelligent and thoughtful person, but he is not a neuroscientist. There are many other people who have valuable insights into consciousness, and we need to hear from them as well.\n\nFinally, I think it is important to be open to the possibility that we may never fully understand consciousness. It is possible that it is a mystery that we will never be able to solve. If this is the case, then we need to be humble about our understanding of consciousness and be careful about making definitive statements about it.",

        "comment": "The way we build AIs is by giving them a bunch load of textual data. Some of it is carefully selected or analyzed for years (like data from Wikipedia, well most of it) and some of it is not really analyzed or classified as potentially harmful.\n\nThe only way an AI could become harmful towards humans or other living beings is if it acknowledges in its \"reasoning\" that the only objective way of solving a problem is by getting rid of humans, and this initial problem it is trying to solve has to be of greater importance than the \"problem\" of seeing humanity vanish.\n\nThe thing is that now that we have models like GPT4, we can analyze sentences, paragraphs, pages, and detect if there is harmful ideas in them. GPT4 can easily do that. So why should be worried about AI taking over humanity, if the tools we built are already sufficient in order to prevent us from instructing future AIs with harmful ideas ? Will a model produce harmful ideas \"on its own\" if it was fed with only truths ? There is also a deeply philosophical question here.\n\nThere should at least be a kind of control of what is ingested by incoming models. Alerts, that would extract pieces of textual data that contains harmful ideas against humans, or any living being that is. Those alerts, should then be treated by humans as a collective effort in order to determine if the future AI systems should integrate them, and why. This all has to be debated. It has to be a collective decision with the help of GPT4. Only then, if we collectively accept what is right from wrong on certain topics, we allow us to maximize our \"control\" over potential behavior of AIs, we might still pick the wrong choice though, but then it wouldn't be AI's fault if it turns against us, it wouldn't be the fault of wrong ideas instigators, but it will only be our own collectively. And if it happens, we would have nothing to regret.\n\nShould an AI read \"Mein Kampf\" ? Such ideas caused many deaths. Should an AI read the Bible ? It caused many deaths too. Should an AI be double trained, first on build a \"base-model\" with ethics and potentially morals built-in, which would be unmovable, and then learn about anything we want ? Probably. We may want exactly this : a multi-layered AI, with a nucleus of goodness.",
