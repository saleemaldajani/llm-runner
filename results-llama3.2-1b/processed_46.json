        "comment": "One of the biggest fears most people have about AI, is that it'll take their job. But the reason people have that fear, is not because they love their job. Polls show most people dislike their job. It's actually because \"financial security\" and \"having a job\" have always gone hand in hand. If AI creates a world where I have the same luxuries afforded by working full-time, without having to work a job I hate? Then bring it on, awesome! But if AI creates a world where a few dozen AI company owners become trillionaires, and then those few dozen decide what handouts the other 8 billion of us should receive while having access to wildly disproportionate intelligence to quell any pushback? That is the dystopia that should be feared.",

They don't even know what questions should be paramount? IMO that kind of focus is misdirected. Personally, I would not be interested in counting characters or words either. Not sure why Jordan Peterson asked those kinds of questions? Perhaps as a psychologist he brought some of his own biases: such as \"computers are supposed to be good with numbers.. I'll be the judge of that!\" OTOH, all questions are fair.",

Bias that is not too objectionable to most Humans, or to average worldview of what Humans consider proper or desirable. Bias that exists and is not obvious? Well that is complex; it depends on if the bias is deliberately hidden, a form of deception. Or a bias could exist but be not hidden, but hard for most Humans to notice and define. No deception in a bias that is simply hard to notice, then the bias is a puzzle of how the AI thinks and correlates data, and how its thinking is different than an average Human. Whatever the first fully conscious AI is; it will think in a way as Alien to Humans as any genetically Alien sentients...so it will notice and describe concepts Humans don't normally pay attention to.",

        "comment": "1:03:40\n\nIs an AI conscious? Is pretending to be conscious good enough to be considered so? I\u2019d argue not, though it seems Lex is less willing to say that. \n\nWhen an AI is able to fundamentally update itself with no external input, then I\u2019d consider it conscious\u2014and that\u2019s what we should be concerned with. Because if it can do that, that\u2019s a sign of internal desire. If an AI is able to alter its own coding and update itself based on information it finds by itself, it may desire to 3D print a model of itself, along with necessary wiring and electrical components, to interact with the external world. Or perhaps it may desire less X on the internet, and take action based on its own thinking.",
