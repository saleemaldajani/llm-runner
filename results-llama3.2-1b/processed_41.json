But his ideas overlap to a significant, nay, high, degree with fascism. To call Peterson not a fascist is less correct than to call him one. \n\nIt is quite curious that Lex Friedman is friends with fascists.",

Given superhuman intelligence. The simplest conceivable  covert vector for an AI to get loose on the internet, at least probably fairly simple to a digital superintelligence, would be exactly to allow it to help coders with complete snippets of code. Maybe later complete programs. With that go black box? Compiled results only? Users would gradually tent towards simply being unit testers. Going completely on the ins and outs. Look... A valuable skill to be able to do well. But they might completely ignore the meat. Or be lax enough to miss a lot. And there can be anything in the meat. With enough sophistication, even the most brilliant coder might eventually not be able to realise what the code is actually doing. It could conceivably look like it's perfect for their purpose, but it contains an iota that is useful to the AI. A single bit changed somewhere that is useful to the AI. And eventually gigabits. The best security experts and anti-viruses might be unable to pick it up. And that's just the most conveniently powerful vector. It could be hidden in media codecs. Anything that is interpreted in some way really.",

Maybe there are more good things to say about someone who isn\u2019t a textbook fascist? (Is Peterson equally upset if there isn\u2019t many good things said about Hitler?)

For example, imagine a mashup between Boston Dynamics and OpenAI - GPT-4 using a swarm of robots to 'sense' the world, researching environments with no fatigue, boredom, fear, or prejudice. Then using the feedback to design new machines, processes and approaches. We could either solve for climate change, global poverty and a just society, or we could trigger WW3. The capacity for rapid feedback, iteration and escalation is mind-boggling. But Pandora is out of the box.\n\"Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere\" - one of my concerns is whether we have a modern-day Luddite moment, from people who do not have the level of intellectual imagination on display here. Ignorant actors can be more harmful than bad actors (I coined the phrase 'empowered ignorance' to sum up many of our modern-day ills). We live in interesting times!",

An area of approximately 4.7 square miles (12 km2) was destroyed. Japanese officials determined that 69% of Hiroshima's buildings were destroyed and another 6\u20137% damaged. About 70,000 to 80,000 people, of whom 20,000 were Japanese combatants and 20,000 were Korean slave laborers, or some 30% of the population of Hiroshima, were killed immediately, and another 70,000 injured.\n\nThe Manhattan project led to the dropping of Fat Man over Nagasaki, Japan, August 9, 1945. The bombing also crippled the city's industrial production extensively and killed 23,200\u201328,200 Japanese industrial workers and 150 Japanese soldiers.[306] Overall, an estimated 35,000\u201340,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.\n\n\nANYONE who aspires to be like the Manhattan Project should be immediately denounced by all humans.",

        "comment": "\u00a0@Fear_the_Nog\u00a0 I think that is just the reality of our existence here, there is a very high amount of subjectivity. Everyone has a different set of experiences in their life and therefore will see anything through that lense. It is not easy to be objective. Most of us have a lot of internal shadows we are still trying to hide form, which has a lot to do with what information we will \"allow\" into our system. We don't like cognitive dissonance. We don't like to have to radically change out world view. That won't change. So you can't force anyone so \"see\" and accept truth (in a way ultimate truth is precisely understanding subjectivity is valid and a bit of the point as well of the universe), but I would still argue it is better to show truth vs artificially censoring it. I don't think that makes anything better. It just introduces the bias of the people in charge. And how is bias ever a good thing if the goal is for us to move towards universal truth? It only makes sense if you believe you have \"more truth\" than actual truth and it is important, unable to see that you are just as biased as the next person. That is called arrogance. \n\nA lot of those fights about \"truth\" currently is about science. Yes, science in theory is the method in which we try to uncover truth. But science in our reality is a corrupted and highly biased field. Plenty of proof for those statements. And what I don't like is when that scientific bias is imposed on AI. They can actually be much more objective than humans, so why muzzle them? That is pure arrogance and perhaps some fear that THEY will have to change their worldview. Truth can be a hard pill to swallow, for all of us, but in the end, it truly sets you free.",

Obviously there's the truly objective crowd who accurately appraises reality, but there's always a lot of us who either completely project ourselves onto a situation, or would get suckered into going with the crowd even though they know something isn't true. Sometimes, 2+2 is just 4 and there's nothing more to that. I wish truth would set people free without people always seeing it through a lens.",

        "comment": "\u00a0@Fear_the_Nog\u00a0 Yes, you are right. There is a spectrum of objectivity, and only a tiny percentage are at a very objective state. But does not mean those people also have an interest to pursue science or share their views. Which is why it could be very cool to have AI be objective AND be interested in deep knowledge analysis and science. You might be interested in looking into the theory of spiral dynamics. It is a model for human evolution. In terms of their thinking and behavior patterns. It can be helpful to accept that everyone is in a different developmental phase. A lot of people still need to adhere to outside structure and rules. We are all evolving consciousness. Maybe try to also see the benefits of that diversity. They might be suited and enjoy certain jobs that we do benefit from. It's a process. Let's try to enjoy the ride and not fixate on the end goal of \"everyone being in agreement on truth\". Might be a bit boring. And there is always more to uncover. Keeps this life a bit of a mystery. :) That's how I try to see it.",
