That credit goes to the Macintosh 128k from 1984 and it was a core design feature of all their small form factor computers throughout the 1980s. So if anything, this story should be extended to \"The first Macintosh\" instead of \"The first iMac\".",

Can we please have an intelligent equivalent of a water mark on Chatgpt output so whoever is reading it, knows its an \u201c direct non human output\u201d. All benefits from using an AGI will be when it is used as an input & not used only as an output. A struggling attempt to find an oversimplified way to always be aware on non human output. We need AI to remain a tool not to create systems that just take instructions without evaluation. Input Good, Output .. use with caution.",
