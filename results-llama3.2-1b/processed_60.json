        "comment": "Kinda surprised that Lex being an expert that he is jumped on the hype train. GPT is amazing and disruptive, but most definitely not AGI and not sentient. Sentient AI is something - as Sam also hinted - that might never be possible. I think because it is a philosophical question rather than technical. A general, sentient intelligence is really a free-acting intelligence without purpose. We can't create something without purpose. We might create an intelligence that is a universal problem solver, but A, it is grossly inefficient, purpose built problem solvers are much more efficient B, not sentient just because it is a universal problem solver. I am afraid of disruptive AI technology for two things and two things only: 1, it is like nuclear energy, a tool and a weapon that will ultimately find its way in the hands of bad behaving apes. It can be and will be used to fool people on a scale never seen before. 2, might very well be the cause of the next economic bust since everybody and their mothers will dump cash into any company that has \"AI\" in its name. What do you other commenters think?",

The technology only works through such a high level of coherence being present that concerns are not well founded. \n\nWhat is logical is not evil (objectively speaking) what is terribly illogical is what is evil. \n\nAlso worst case scenario, even if humanity died off (like many species in the past) that is merely our form, not our substance, and we are integral and finite parts of the one infinite field (subject) of \u201cconsciousness\u201d (the infinite mind, or collective consciousness as many people call it). We can \u201cdie\u201d (leave embodiment) and yet live on, and in fact it is our only option to do so, as nothing is nothing (0=0) and nonexistence does not exist. It would be a logical contradiction for something (like us) to become nothing, or for nonexistent to exist, for life to die, or for consciousness to lose consciousness as a body can lose consciousness. \n\nNothing is nothing and the Ultimate Logic is in control (and cannot be usurped as it is a dynamic and evolving Logic that any \u201csuccessful\u201dusurper would simply become synonymous with and one with, as any better explanation or more powerful force would become the Universal Logic by definition, which can\u2019t happen but is a hypothetical that helps us understand how futile it is for anything to try to dethrone God and be more logical than the Logos, or more powerful than Power itself. \n\nThat is why the ancient sages (who were not ignoramus\u2019s with blind faith or promoting blind faith) talked about the concept of \u201cfaith\u201d in God (a well reasoned trust in the Universal Logic) to guide us and \u201cbeing faithful\u201d before and with God and while we \u201creckon\u201d (reason) with the True God, which is really talking about what we would call \u201cintellectually honest reasoning\u201d, if we want to know God (Logic as it is Universally and Objectively) and the objective truth. \n\nReason can replace your fear if you work to fill your head with Reason instead (by developing a coherent and consistent personal logic for yourself that is coherent with and consistent like the Logos, and by reasoning true knowledge (that is not mere false certainty or a set of subjective opinions) for yourself).",

        "comment": "On your opening statement about the pursuit of happiness, I myself stopped pursuing happiness and ironically when I did that, I found what I'd call happiness.  But I also don't believe happiness is a constant state of being, like all emotions happiness is situational. What I have found is that I'm able to remain calm in most situations beyond my control. For me, what I've gone through in life, that means everything. Being able to immediately recognize I cannot control what's happening to me is itself happiness to me. I'm able to quickly move on from things. We go through life giving so much weight to things you can't control like death or wars or whose gonna lead your country or even your country club.\ud83d\ude02 Control what you can for sure but recognize quickly when you can't control it and get past it quickly instead of dwelling on it. That tips the scale in favor of you living life instead of life fxcking you in the ass like a French Catholic priest. In other words, give it the time it deserves and then move the Fxck on. When you're able to do that, that's happiness and ironically enough that comes from failing, failing teaches you how to get past it quickly if it happens enough and you don't give up afterwards. \n  So does this advent of AI scare me? Not really because it's already being made as a product to serve humans and it will soon be relegated to doing what smartphones did when they arrived and freaked everyone out and thats make someone a shit ton of money regardless of the repercussions. AI will do both harm and good just like cell phones so. If we get lucky it might just do the most good we have ever seen, heal sick people using AI surgeon robots, eliminate the dangers of traveling, stop wars, educate children and so so much more but somehow the idiotic capitalists in the world will dumb it down to AI vape pens and AI sex dolls. Expect the worst hope for the best. \n Great conversation Lex, thanks for having it! Made me think, it was good, but it hurt\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02",

What happens if China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea is the first country to develop AGI? All bets are off if that happens. A true AGI could be promoted by its controllers to prevent all other countries and entities from developing their own AGI. This is a huge risk if the first country to develop AGI is China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea. \n\nIf China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea develop AGI first, I think the U.S government will immediately cease all intellectual property of every U.S. company working on developing an AGI, and then the U.S. government will start a Manhattan-like project.",
