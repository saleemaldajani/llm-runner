AI teaching yout to read and write may take over early education but social agreement that is a base of human to human education will be very difficlut to replace by AI.",

I have been thinking about the inevitable growth of AI, and I have wondered about AI in teaching and education.  I can se how GPT would help in designing quizzes and general assessment tools but I am troubled by how we actually carry out assessment of student tasks if we don't know if it was the student who provided the answer or AI (GPT).  If for example we ask the student for a 200 word essay on a topic, then it would seem like it is possible/probable that the student would use GPT to construct the 2000 word essay.  How would we know?  This would be a problem, especially with on-line learning and assessment.  What are your thoughts & experiences with this?",

        "comment": "\u00a0@robgage8100\u00a0 I keep thinking about it too. Depending on the level of education, assessment would have to go back to classrooms so students would have to write it independently. It makes sense in a secondary school but may be a huge obstacle in college or at Uni. The solution to this would be assessment completed based on coursework which again would require students to do the work on site.... For online learning I have no remedy. University assignments, Masters, PhDs, all may benefit students but skew the assessment results. However, if a student can lead AI correctly to compile a piece of work that is correct, well researched and structured and provided authentic insight supported by language model AI.... Does it mean the student has not show it's knowledge and understanding of the topic?",

Without it people wouldn't know how to think, where to find information, how to draw conclusions, how to connect information cross curriculum. School shouldn't teach to facts but what to do with them. And, following your mindset, people leave school without basic knowledge not only factual but also contextual. And their response to everything is \"dunno\". Trust me, I have 17 year old's who never thought it would be a good idea to read BBC news from time to time, they don't even know we will be witnessing King's coronation next week and keep asking why we are going to have a national day off. You don't have to love Royals to know absolute basic about current affairs. I gave y10 origami for their tutor time yesterday, 15 out of 20 never tried to fold paper and surprisingly- they liked it. Tried smth new, used their hands, followed instructions, and ended up with more or less accurate folded crab. AI will never replace brain work young people need. Clever teacher may use AI to lead students more efficiently without quitting teaching due to burn out and serve the population longer. But students MUST learn how to learn. For life, benefit for themselves and their kids.",

By breaking down content of the lesson, providing a good variety of tasks and chunking them you can keep attention of a hen for 2 hrs. \n2. No, older generations know much more facts than young one. Ask your parnets to name all continents or  list all countries starting with Z and they will recite you all you want. Young generation struggles to tell the difference between a city and a country. At least in the USA. The style of education has changed since our parents were at school, and while we rememebr a lot of factual content, students now don't know what to look for unless they are taught.\n3. Tools are exactly that- a tool. A student who is taught at school how to use them, with background knowlede in subjects will be able to use them creatively. However, some people can't ever pick up a pencil and be creative, no matter what quality of tools will you provide. Simiralily, creative kid will take a lollipop stick and scratch a paint on the wall to release creativity there.... School must provide a challenge for those kids and make sure those less creative will also be ale to find their niche somewhere",

By breaking down content of the lesson, providing a good variety of tasks and chunking them you can keep attention of a hen for 2 hrs. \n2. No, older generations know much more facts than young one. Ask your parnets to name all continents or  list all countries starting with Z and they will recite you all you want. Young generation struggles to tell the difference between a city and a country. At least in the USA. The style of education has changed since our parents were at school, and while we rememebr a lot of factual content, students now don't know what to look for unless they are taught.\n3. Tools are exactly that- a tool. A student who is taught at school how to use them, with background knowlede in subjects will be able to use them creatively. However, some people can't ever pick up a pencil and be creative, no matter what quality of tools will you provide. Simiralily, creative kid will take a lollipop stick and scratch a paint on the wall to release creativity there.... School must provide a challenge for those kids and make sure those less creative will also be ale to find their niche somewhere",

        "comment": "\u00a0@Thereal_prettyinblack\u00a0 You sound to me like a great teacher. And I don't think anyone should worry about teachers losing jobs. Anyone who's paying attention to education knows that one of the biggest issues right now is that there aren't enough teachers. Similar with nursing. In both professions there are issues with burnout. If AIs can help teachers become 'super teachers' and students to become 'super learners', then that will be a great outcome. Teaching and learning could both become more fun again. It will be more productive if people think about ways to accomplish that goal instead of predicting gloom from their computer chairs or smart phones. There's a difference between educated caution and reactionary fear.",

        "comment": "\u00a0@JohnMauneyIV\u00a0 Unfortunately my looong reply has vanished since I posted it... I agree. There were some scared voices in this thread about 'better being scared than surprised' and so on. If someone wants to live in fear, there is nothing I can say to stop them. However such people must be aware that as soon a fear steps in, learning stops. Not just in school but also in life. As soon as we start being affraid of something, there is no way we can make it familiar and comfortable to deal with. Those people will never make another concious step towards mastering a new skill. \nAnd someone also said that the only jobs that will not be threaten bby AI will be manual jobs like mechanics etc. Really? With technology becoming more and more clever to force customers to buy new cars, fridges, washing machines instead of fixing old ones? Soon, we will 'focus' on recycling' to the point it will be easier to return an electric car back to the manufacturer for dismantle and reuse than to fix it. We become more independent than ever, in 17 years of living in the UK I have never asked anyone to fix my washing machine, I was just getting another, used one, which was cheaper than repair. WHile back in the country where I come from, we had a perfectly working Candy machine since the 80s that didn't need a repair in more than 25 years. That was not feeding Candy well. I went into a trap of having a good opinion about this brand and I once bought brand new Candy n the UK. It broke 2 months after it's manufacturer guarantee. I would seriously reconsider 'safety' of manual work in an era of AI, that's for someone who likes to be afraid beforehand. :D",

        "comment": "Well, I think there is probably a new sort of joy to be found.  AIs don\u2019t have enough context, loose associations, and models to architect a system well.  Maybe with time and development, computing power, if patterns are found for simple systems, it may take all interesting work out of it.  But, for anything sort of new, creative, or complex, Carefully chosen prompts will be needed to help guide: optimization points, schemas and design to accommodate needs well. Those needs need to be found and fed to the AI.  So, still fun? \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude04\n\nI mean have we ended our journey in science just because we have AI? Of product development? I think not.  There\u2019ll be interesting things to work on, which may include software systems to make use of that new science or product.",
