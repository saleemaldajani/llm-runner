And using gpt for the first time I sorta had a similar feeling to that, but also I can imagine how this is a point in time where gpt is the Dos prompt of AI and not too long from now we will be in a very advanced operating system like windows 11, only much much faster to reach that point. It definitely is a mixture of being worried, but also excited. We're creatures of habit and the transition is going to be against the grain for a lot of people.",

Emotion and our ability to balance emotion with intellect is actually at the very core of what defines consciousness. Altman's ignorance of this, coupled with his willingness to espouse truths that are actually lies directly parallels  the dangers of his creation, ChatGPT , which continuously does the same thing. Altman's character IS ChatGPT's character- they both suffer from acute narcissistic personality disorder and are both obviously unaware of their problem. They may apologize, wear a mask of humility, and act as if they understand other's perspectives, but do not be fooled- Altman is chronically self absorbed and pathologically lacks empathy. His flawed moral character makes him a profoundly dangerous person to be in charge of a technology that could lead to the most significant period of human suffering in our history. If Altman was sincere in his quest to properly manage the AI alignment problem, he would be seeking out the advice, counsel and leadership of the foremost experts in human consciousness and morality (in academia, psychology, and religious spirituality). He should set up an independent advisory counsel to offer him consistent criticism and suggestions. Because the stakes could not be higher. Unfortunately, Altman appears to be relying on cocktail conversations to guide him forward.",

        "comment": "Sam Altman declares emotion is not a fundamental element of consciousness. This is simply not true. Emotion and our ability balance emotion with intellect is actually at the very core of what defines consciousness. Altman's ignorance of this, coupled with his willingness to espouse truths that are actually lies directly parallels  the dangers of his creation, ChatGPT , which continuously does the same thing. Altman's character IS ChatGPT's character- they both suffer from acute narcissistic personality disorder and are both obviously unaware of their problem. They may apologize, wear a mask of humility, and act as if they understand other's perspectives, but do not be fooled- Altman is chronically self absorbed and pathologically lacks empathy. His flawed moral character makes him a profoundly dangerous person to be in charge of a technology that could lead to the most significant period of human suffering in our history. If Altman was sincere in his quest to properly manage the AI alignment problem, he would be seeking out the advice, counsel and leadership of the foremost experts in human consciousness and morality (in academia, psychology, and religious spirituality). He should set up an independent advisory counsel to offer him consistent criticism and suggestions. Because the stakes could not be higher. Unfortunately, Altman appears to be relying on cocktail conversations to guide him forward.",

Secondly, much of the way it responds will vary depending on how you ask the question, or even with the same question if you put it in a new chat, and try again, or simply follow up questions you can get fairly different answers.",
