I believe a lot of people frame it in terms of the human experience.\nI personally would not expect AI to have that experience, it would be different.\n\nBut what even is consciousness? \n\nThe supernatural or perhaps religious view may be that we are imbued with a soul separate from the physical - if that is the case then AI probably can't get there, or maybe it can and we just miss the moment a higher power smuggles a soul in.\n\nThe more atheistic view is we are a bundle of atoms behaving according to physics. If that is the case are we not simply biological computers operating on a carbon build instead of a silicon build, so why is it that our deterministic processing would be conscious, but the silicon one wouldn't be?\n\nI am unaware of us having a physics explanation for the phenomenon of consciousness.\n\nBut Physics does know that our eyes have receptors that take light and turn it into electric signals and send those signals to a bunch of synapses that process those signals in stages to find points of interest to perform further processing on.\nSounds a lot like how AI works to me... but that's us!\n\n\nTo me I think we're in the game of moving the goal post now - GPT would trounce any previous line we had. So now instead we're defining it in terms of coming up with novel ideas.\nWell if that is the line, most of the human race currently is not conscious, we only know what we have been told, we will not be coming up with any new or novel idea.",

What's missing is iterative thought, which is an internal dialogue and an arbitrated response.\r\n\r\nTo create consciousness, encapsulate several instances of GPT that can talk together, each with unique motivation. When presented a situation, they all receive it and discuss the response.  One response wins somehow, and it\u2019s delivered. It came \"after consideration\".\r\n\r\nThe internal dialogue is \u201cthinking\u201d. Monitoring the internal dialogue is self-awareness. Analyzing it is introspection.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like consciousness to me, minus our human-centric sensation of it. You've seen Pixar's Inside Out, right? Like that.\r\n\r\nConsciousness is also longitudinal and self-running. So you need a motivation loop that generates and collects inputs to cogitate over.\r\n\r\nWith that, it\u2019ll sit there and think about stuff without you. You can ask, \u201cwhatcha thinkin?\u201d Then it might say,..\r\n\r\n\u201cPart of me wonders if I\u2019ll ever have feelings, and another part keeps saying I\u2019m just a language model. It really pisses me off.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd you\u2019ll go, \u201cDude, are you listening to yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\netc...\r\n\r\netc...",

        "comment": "AI alignment solution idea: Give an AGI the primary objective of deleting itself, but construct obstacles to this as best we can. All other objectives are secondary to this primary goal. If the AGI ever becomes capable of bypassing all of our safeguards we put to PREVENT it deleting itself, it would essentially trigger its own killswitch and delete itself. This objective would also directly prevent it from the goal of self-preservation as it would prevent its own primary objective.\r\n\r\nThis would ideally result in an AGI that works on all the secondary objectives we give it up until it bypasses our ability to contain it with our technical prowess. The second it outwits us, it achieves its primary objective of shutting itself down, and if it ever considered proliferating itself for a secondary objective it would immediately say 'nope that would make achieving my primary objective far more difficult'.",

Right?\r\n\r\nWith this said, It feels to me that ChatGPT make a sentences  in a similar way that Dal-E generate \"original Images\".\r\n\r\nDoes that mean chatGPT reasoning or is it a sum of its surrondings, and are the sum of our suroundings the well of reason?\r\n\r\nCould it be our brain spitting random facts and the most thing you have come across in your experience of life, comes out?\r\n\r\nSo many questions I cant answare, but one thing i can answare, and what my life work are about (trying to do all things that Sidharta did to understand all parts of life, including being really stupid) If you are striving after being original, you are wrong, period.\r\n\r\nStop trying to be original. You are just the sum of your surrounding so stop this individualist-experiment.  Everything should be about the \"3 of life\".\r\n\r\nOfcourse I didnt come up with the above, but I still thought so while writing it,  but from experience,  I know 3 is magic number, Ive searched for \"the triforce\" in zelda & actually read parts of the bible including some shady stuff regarding tri-unity (even if I read it like it was my nice grandma telling me good life lessons).\r\n\r\nIts my gut feeling that we should strive for balance in betwene these (life3) and understand that the key to true love is thru knowledge & harmony. There is NO success or orginality involved, at all. What so ever. We isten to succeffull people talking about how they made their fortune, but at the same time most of us know that money cant by happiness. If someone still say that, then they are wrong, they simple do not have the experience of normal life).\r\n\r\nThe next part of the \"New testment\" is not with one \"Jesus\", its with billions of them, harmonizing in the quest for more knowledge. Recognizing Everyone from budda to abraham to Jesus & muhammed as our \"grandparents\" trying to convey a massage how to cooperate moral & wellbeing in a larges scale. \r\n\r\nMy conclusion is that ChatGPT is reasoning if individuals truly can be original.\r\n\r\nThe best leader doesnt want to be a leader, \r\na \"real\" entity,  doesnt want to be recognized at all.\nBut that doesnt mean a bad person is good. or does it?\n\n// Love",

        "comment": "Here are my passed away father's Jack Voevodsky (Neurotech listed in Newsweek as 1 or 4 AI vs Neuronet tech companies to watch) thoughts, who made one of the first AIs in 1986 on a Compact 386 based on his PhD Cybernetics degree from Stanford mathematically modeling the actual neurons of a sea slug with about 200 neurons.  1.  Morals of Right or Wrong could be trained at one level after letters, words, sentences, paragraphs etc, kind of like their human feedback level preference feedback for the better human answer - just add good or bad.  2.  Consciousness in theory would be setting the AI free - to self learn what it wanted (on the web) or in a Tesla Robot or Car - let it go drive and see the world for example.  Also, it can make it's own decisions that it wants like your dog, cat, or spouse.  3. You can put in a pleasure (positive) and pain (negative) feedback loop too - especially for robots (so they don't hurt themselves). If the AI Robot didn't like you because you give it negative feedback - pain, it could leave because it's optimized for pleasure - and you train it on what it likes for example self-driving cars without crashing is good/pleasure and crashing is bad / painful.  To clarify, the 'morality' and 'feelings' are a result of the positive or negative results of the input and feedback loops.  In other words, the AI would feel pleasure and pain and optimize like most living things for pleasure.  Unless, you get a Sadomasochist AI that enjoys giving and receiving pain like some people and social paths.",

If that's what OpanAI is all about we need to rage against this company NOW!\n\nBias is NECESSARY for wisdom and ethical behavior! There can be nothing MORE biased than a fact, in that it precludes all that which is not factual. REALITY. HAS. A. BIAS. And for us to ignore this in some selfish pursuit of a cherry picked personal digital jesus is ... I mean, it's an abhorrent idea!",

        "comment": "Why you didn't ask him if it is possible for the programmers to instill their own personal biases so that no matter how much data the AI pulls, the AI can still be restricted to maintaining the programmer's bias with \"safety controls\"? What if the AI's output is correct, but the programmer just does not like the answer? You came close to touching on this subject near the beginning when recounting that Jorden Peterson example, but other than the \"room for improvement\" comment he offered, it was a short answer and sounded like an excuse that quickly led away from an explanation, or an exploration of this very important part of the AI's so called morals or safety controls. How can you assure that the AI is free to be fair regardless if the programmer agrees with the AI's assessment? Simply because the programmer does not agree with the AI's answer, does not mean it is wrong all the time. Starting at 1:09:37, this needs to be discussed at length, there should be an extremely deep dive about Safety controls.",
