I understand that this will evolve with the training data and feedback therefore at large scale should reflect the pulse of the humanity. I have asked Chat GPT this and the answer is amazingly well thought :           \" Sure, here is a summary of some recommended absolute moral rules that could include sentient beings along with humans:\n\nRespect for life: All living beings, including humans and animals, should be treated with respect and their lives should be valued.\n\nNon-violence: The use of violence or harm towards other living beings should be avoided as much as possible.\n\nCompassion: Practicing compassion towards all living beings, and seeking to reduce suffering whenever possible.\n\nJustice and fairness: Treating all beings equitably and fairly, without discrimination or favoritism.\n\nResponsibility: Taking responsibility for the impact of one's actions on other living beings and the environment, and seeking to minimize harm.\n\nSustainability: Ensuring that actions are sustainable and do not deplete resources or harm the environment for future generations of all living beings.\n\nEducation: Seeking to educate oneself and others about the value of all living beings and how to treat them with respect and compassion.\n\nIt's worth noting that these moral rules are not necessarily exhaustive or universally accepted, and different cultures and individuals may have their own specific moral codes. However, they can provide a starting point for considering how to integrate ethical considerations for sentient beings into a broader moral framework that includes humans.\"",

When roles switch and the model is the one able to check for correctness and the \"truth\", that  will be a pivotal point for AI. The truth is in a way a dynamic construction based on human knowledge, so when the model is able to produce new knowledge in fundamental research areas, we will be replaced. Meanwhile there are millions of humans still without access to electricity, internet, and so on. For them AI means nothing.",

This presents a notable example of how IT professionals may lack insight into societal matters. \n\nIt is unlikely to transpire for various reasons, primarily due to the fact that no democratically elected individual at the helm would be inclined to heed a machine. If one occupies a position of decision-making, one can anticipate an inclination to quash any mechanisms that limit one's power of decision, including, among others, AGI. One would, therefore, endeavor to employ all methods sanctioned by society to augment one's leadership role, one of which is already manifest in the deployment of AI systems to regulate the populace in the guise of security.\n\nIn essence, AGI may not lead democracy, but instead, it will be used to control it. Such control could result in a considerable increase in societal efficiency; however, it also has its pitfalls. Very dark ones.",

        "comment": "Guys, I really enjoyed your conversation. But what leaves me puzzled is the idea of AI governance and a human AI ethics committee. Currently in many countries there are laws about what can be said and what not. These are clarified and disputed in law cases and court decisions. All of that is (mostly) publicly available. Written in a hard to understand language, at least for the average human. But this task should be fairly easy for a large language model. Why do you see a need for additional structures and rules when not even the current ones are incorporated yet?",

There are serious problems.  AI is not perfect.  GPT-4 is awesome, but it makes mistakes and that is fine,  but most real world applications require perfection that AI has yet to offer. \n\nThat sounds like a trivial problem, but It is not.  Ai can't be trusted and that is why people still have jobs.  Some people predicted a decade ago that this would not be the case.  In spite of an insane amount of processing power since then,  millions of AI developers world wide, it's still a problem.  Why?  Also consider what it took to develop GPT-4.  I think ChatGPT is fun...I'm not threatened by it.  Now there is talk to pause AI development, but we have a long way to go, IMO.",
