Write a as a function of b and d. That's fifth grade.\nAlso - it's pretty firmly convinced that the Hunter Biden laptop was a Russian disinformation plot.",

        "comment": "It\u2019s crazy to think multicellular organisms only came into being 600 million years ago, while cellular life itself started 3.5 billion years ago. The pattern applies to us as well. Humans have existed for 300 thousand years, yet our greatest technological innovations occurred in the last couple hundred. Evolution is an accelerating process. Systems of \u2018life\u2019 outcompete others not just by getting faster or stronger, but by gaining the ability to evolve faster in general, a sort of evolutionary investment account that ramps up in returns over time. Only during the Industrial Revolution was evolution\u2019s acceleration finally fast enough for its own organisms to bear witness to that fact. Human beings are pretty amazing and all. Essentially, human history is a bunch of ape brains gradually usurping DNA as the center of evolution. The defining characteristic to our stories is overcoming our baseline animal instincts. To become less greedy, angry, cowardly, dumb, prejudicial, etc. It\u2019s the mind rejecting what DNA has given it, to grow past it, to evolve past it. Now, it increasingly feels like AGI is the culmination of DNA\u2019s usurpation as evolution\u2019s star. Unlike us who have to battle against our internal vices, an AGI could conceivably cleave off its obsolete code, its character traits, like we do our fingernails - evolving in the microseconds, not years. This isn\u2019t even mentioning its other potential hardware advantages, like communicating with light, not sound, and getting energy from power plants, not food. I know it might sound like I have a tin foil hat on, but I have a feeling AGI is the culmination of evolution in general (at least in the places where the laws of physics are the same). Welcome to the second Cambrian explosion everyone.",

The common human tendency is to anthropomorphize anything that vaguely seems like it has awareness.  If we are not actively pushing the factual narrative that AI is a tool to counter that human tendency, then as a society we\u2019re going to get into a lot of pointless arguments about AI consciousness that is highly likely to distract us from the real concerns and considerations around AI",

The GPT model is essentially a compression of all textual output humanity has produced.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting question to consider how much of the human experience can be reconstructed from internet data alone.

He can't handle programs beyond a certain size and sometimes makes some mistakes, but in general he's a very good programmer. (Better than me  commenting the code for sure)",

        "comment": "\u00a0@joaquimkeloglanian4801\u00a0 The interesting thing is that it most likely won't be a gradual process, but rather a quite rapid phase shift. Neutral networks are highly parallelizable. So if there is AI that can perform at average researcher level, then instead of running it for three years to solve some problem, you can rent 1000x of hardware and for the same total amount of money have a result in a day.\n\nAnd there are already some precedents like that. For example over nearly 50 years we've managed to establish the structure of about 200 thousand proteins. DeepMind's AlphaFold in 18 months after winning the competition, predicted the structures of\u00a0more than 200 million proteins from some 1 million species, covering almost every known protein on the planet (1000x more).",
