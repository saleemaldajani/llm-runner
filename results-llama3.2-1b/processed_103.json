However, GPT and similar technologies have distinct advantages over basic search engines, which I believe is important for you to consider.\n\nFirstly, GPT-based systems can provide more concise and coherent responses to queries, as they are designed to understand the context and generate human-like responses. This can save time and effort compared to sifting through multiple sources on a search engine. \n\nSecondly, these technologies are continuously improving and learning from new data, making their responses more accurate and relevant over time. While search engines do update their algorithms, they often rely on users to discern the reliability of the information presented.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that no tool is perfect, and both GPT and search engines have their limitations. However, dismissing GPT-based technologies as inherently flawed or refusing to acknowledge their potential benefits will only hinder your ability to adapt and make use of these tools effectively in the future. \n\nBeing intentionally obtuse and dismissive about such technologies may result in missed opportunities to learn and grow. Instead, I encourage you to approach these technologies with an open mind and a willingness to learn how to use them correctly, as they can offer valuable insights and streamline information access if used appropriately.\n\n--teehee",

Not just use it to make silly stories, create hilarious insults to use against your friends, or try to use to make political points. I've been using it a lot to help further my understanding of technical nerd stuff that I like to do. It's awesome for stuff like that because you can explain to it what you're doing and then ask questions and it will answer them in a way that has the context of what you're doing. Unlike searching google in which you might find something related, but then you have to figure how and if you can map that to your specific needs.\n\nI also recently used it to learn how pool pump systems work because I had to figure one out. I used it in conjunction with some other resources, but I was able to use that clarify and dig into concepts that I didn't fully grasp. I would ask questions if I understood something correctly too, and it would give a reasonable response. Sure, maybe it could give some false information, but that  is why we don't just completely give in and have it guide us completely. It's a tool. A very useful tool.",

Noam Chomsky said recently that while AI can \"think\", it can't *introspect*. It needs some kind of guidance, error correction, error checking. \n\n...and thus it goes down the line until we get to, \"what is truth?\" What is real? What is fact? What is the hierarchy of \"truth\" from different levels of sources?",

Here's something I wrote in reply to someone else...\n\n\"You have to use it for stuff that is important to you. Not just use it to make silly stories, create hilarious insults to use against your friends, or try to use to make political points. I've been using it a lot to help further my understanding of technical nerd stuff that I like to do. It's awesome for stuff like that because you can explain to it what you're doing and then ask questions and it will answer them in a way that has the context of what you're doing. Unlike searching google in which you might find something related, but then you have to figure how and if you can map that to your specific needs.\n\nI also recently used it to learn how pool pump systems work because I had to figure one out. I used it in conjunction with some other resources, but I was able to use that clarify and dig into concepts that I didn't fully grasp. I would ask questions if I understood something correctly too, and it would give a reasonable response. Sure, maybe it could give some false information, but that  is why we don't just completely give in and have it guide us completely. It's a tool. A very useful tool.\"",

The professor is really smart and knows what he's talking about, but he's still only giving you one answer and his understanding of it. Google is a library giving you every article, web page and book that has ever been written on any subject. Clearly they're not the same.",

The point is that ChatGPT gives you something that google or just going through books cannot. It gives you responses in the context of what you're doing. At least it does if you're using it in a way to get those results. It doesn't replace traditional sources. It's just another tool (an awesome tool) that is used in addition to those. We also keep in mind that we're still pretty early in the development of this stuff. It's very useful as it is now when used correctly. I can only imagine how much more useful it will be in the future.",

Don't have the fact  on my fingers but i would say at least  6/10 searches on google are general enquiries without a target link or specific scope of material  in mind. Even is there is a scope, laboring to find  them within  links is already a caveman sport. And no, gpt is not only better interpreting but it astronomically quickens and seamlessly facilitates an interactive  learning space in real time. It's not about what google currently does better,  those things are an update away from an Ai standpoint. it's about what google the search engine won't be able to do at all when the way we demand and access information en mass slowly and inevitably changes. They better allocate most  resources to AI because google the search engine will be the duckduckgo of today in 3-5 years.",

If you're the typical student, you blindly trust the presumed expertise of the prof and 9/10 times can't be bothered with more information or perspectives about it. we are wired to get  non-academic information where there's least resistance and that's why GPT even at its infancy is a 10x more productive engine than google, regardless of googles libraries of sources.",

        "comment": "A large language model like chat gpt is nothing more than a text based version of Alexa which is a verbal natural language interface.    By itself chatgpt only knows how to have a conversation in a given language but not using spoken language.  However, being that it has a large volume of data it has been trained on, there is also the idea that a useful side effect of such a model is that there is some kind of knowledge embedded in it by default.   But that embedded knowledge is not perfect knowledge or genius level knowledge of any specific domain in a rigorous sense and cannot be sold as such.  However, a lot of discussion about these side effects implies that it is somehow more than it is because unfortunately those side effects are not robust in and of themselves to be replacements for applications dedicated to specific tasks.  It is just a natural language interface that can be used to augment existing features and applications with natural language capability and functionality.    For example,  chat gpt in bing is not replacing search functionality, but bringing a natural language interface to search.   As time goes on the functionality will evolve and third parties will come up with more use cases for it but by itself it can only do so much.\n\nAlso, the biggest problem with these discussions that I have is that historically the development of computer science as a discipline has always been to augment human intellect and not replace it.  This idea that these algorithms and systems are being designed to be synthetic humans aka AGI is totally false.  Of course computers can calculate things faster than the human brain, but that doesn't make it human. At the end of the day these are tools for humans to use in analyzing, organizing and processing information.",

They also don't waste money as much as unaccountable government peeps do, and they create more wealth and jobs by investing it in businesses that reflect the needs of consumers. Don't allow envy to blind you to the effectiveness of the market in \"redistributing\" capital through the funding of technology.",

        "comment": "yep! theres a FUKTON of money to be made in the non-profit sector for sure..espcially when collaberating with stake holders and industry leaders and innovators as well as leveraging the power of public/ private partnerships to create policies designed to empowering to the real people that need critical services and access food security\n.\nESPECIALLY in the southern hemisphere where the locals are to weaked by continual war to make much of a fuss as their land is stripped and polluted by the various foriegn entities, incl nonprofs, ngo's and so called charities profit immensely and usually at the expense of local population. id rather bill gates kept his money to himself and just let people work out thier own solutions locally based on thier own interests. \n\nthe rape and pillage being done in the name humanitarianism is staggering. \n\nlords and nobles demonstrating their generosity is nothing new. they are just giving the people back a few stale crumbs in the evening from the loaf of bread they stole that morning.",

Not just use it to make silly stories, create hilarious insults to use against your friends, or try to use to make political points. I've been using it a lot to help further my understanding of technical nerd stuff that I like to do. It's awesome for stuff like that because you can explain to it what you're doing and then ask questions and it will answer them in a way that has the context of what you're doing. Unlike searching google in which you might find something related, but then you have to figure how and if you can map that to your specific needs.\n\nI also recently used it to learn how pool pump systems work because I had to figure one out. I used it in conjunction with some other resources, but I was able to use that clarify and dig into concepts that I didn't fully grasp. I would ask questions if I understood something correctly too, and it would give a reasonable response. Sure, maybe it could give some false information, but that  is why we don't just completely give in and have it guide us completely. It's a tool. A very useful tool.",
