It's neutral in the sense that contemporary language can be used to  clarify how we as organisms fit into reality and how to gauge reality with a sound mind.  It can or will eventually serve as a backbone to read between the lines of religions and modern science. \n\nThe problem I've seen with some religious biased people is that they have used it to give more affirmation to what is actually dangerous ideoligy. \n\nThe mere fact that it can make jokes about jesus but not about another prophet as not to cause religious upheavel while their main book mentions isa 94 times and that other prophet only 4 times and not get riled up about jesus jokes is a really messed up double standard and all that while the archeoligy, ancient language experts, proffessors of uniniversities have laid bare so much info online that steers away from the standard accepted narrative.\n\nSo yeah, being protective is fine to a degree, but double standards by AI that keep facts away or credit already biased people. If ai is taking away jobs, then hate preachers shouldn't be keeping their jobs either",

If a prompt triggers filers or algoritmic processes over the response of the network, the system should show that to the user in separate interface UI elements, not just the verbal response... But that's just an example of many things that could be happening there under the hood of that misplaced minimalism of ChatGPT's interface. Complex things should have complex UIs, at least until they are very very final-user-ready.",

AGI is best way for how human can get fast technology medicine for hiv aids, rabies, leukemia, regenerate human cell, and more with not for long time as you die.\n\neven human consciousness can be transferred to a place without fear of growing old and dying. \n\nEvent 1000 years the human brain is limited to thinking, only AGI is the solution for technological speeds beyond human reason.",

        "comment": "AGI is an instance, 1 unit,  of artificial intelligence.\nKind of like how your laptop is one example ( or instance ,)of a computer. The variable we call laptop is a unique type of a marriage of hardware & software. AI is also a marriage of hardware & software but you need data sets to teach it. It\u2019s really close to raising a child!  Just can\u2019t move around on its own. If u want to \u201cmake\u201d a machine capable of artificial intelligence you need a certain set of parts,programs, and date. Musk said there are 3 in our country, three computers that have TONS of powerful computer parts that can run the software. There are 3 of these aiBots in our country so far. \n\nWisdom is intelligence growing through time.",

Then the AI will go to us for validation of the action, just like how we as humans get our validation from some higher, transcendent validation (such as God). In other words, we will cause AI to give us what we need so that we can determine if we want to press the \"execute,\" \"go,\" or \"play\" buttons. No human wants to be bossed around by an AI, and if you do, then you have a problem that you need to fix.",
