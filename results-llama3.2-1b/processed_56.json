The ethical dilemma of corporate law requiring decisions based on quarterly profits is tactfully avoided with this model. I honestly am impressed with the foresight in taking this measure. It  doesn\u2019t take much more than a quick glance at other industries to see the pitfalls of unchecked profit based corporate decisions.\nWell done to both of you.",

In this 2h video you didn't make him address the biggest concerns: DALL-E using copyrighted work without knowledge of artists to make image, as they were non-profit research lab they used a loophole for \"research purpose\" but now open ai is monetised and for profit organisation. In fact they still claim on their page that images are copyrighted for Open AI not for user, while law says there's no copyright at all. Secondly, he didn't address similar thing when it comes with Bing Chat which uses data from internet and provides responses directly causing every newspaper etc loosing On advertisements, as their websited is read but not clicked by user. There are many more tricks they did like proper corporate not \"democratic way\" as he would like to show it.",

We\u2019ve been living with one directing our fates, since February 4th, 2004; when The Zuckerberg first became self aware to create the first Facebook Profile. History will mark that day as the tippiddy top of the downward spiral of our innocence in our known reality. Orchestrated by the machinations of the Zuckerberg A.I.\u2019s excruciatingly slow cringeworthy torment, as we march slowly towards the extinction of the physical act of human socialization. \n\nIn all seriousness, this was the most interesting, eye opening, and thought provoking podcast I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. \n\nI am not sure what I expected, but I am genuinely relieved with this man being in such a powerful position, rather than a sociopath with less of a conscience than ChatGPT, \u00e0 la Zuckerdouche. \n\nI cannot overstate how great of a job you are doing Lex. You help keep my sanity & learn a lot along the way, regarding such a diverse range of topics, and the human condition on a daily basis as I work. Not sure if you will ever see this, and it\u2019s not like my opinion matters anyways; but keep fighting the good fight. \n\nGodspeed & Good Luck",

This is basically \"affirmative action\" (at least the conservative view thereof) but applied to facts: my team should get a boost so that all things appear equal. Both sides ain't the same.",

That's not like embeddings. The AI should be able to manipulate its own weights so the new knowledge becomes part of it's parameters.\n2. Real Time Learning: It must be able to learn something and retain that knowledge, without a ton amount of data. If I teach it the best way to cook bread, it should remember (see point #1) and spit it out to other people that ask about it. It must take that knowledge and generalize it like a human would.\n\nBoth of those abilities are within our grasp. I think they will be solved this year. Once they do, AI will be able to improve exponentially by itself. Instead of a fixed-sized model, with 175B parameters, it will START with, say, 175B and keep growing as it interacts with humans and more data.",

Countries like Russia and China couldn\u2019t handle the needs of everyone with central planning. \n\nCould an AGI conduct optimization at many levels, probably technically yes, But there would be no way for leaders to be in touch with their constituents if they only rely on AGI, and in a world where you have biased AGI.\n\nAlso what goes on in said states and cities when the lights turn off from natural disaster, war, or solar event? Ultra dependency on the non local federal government. \n\nRant over, point is we need to use AGI to instead of being 10x more efficient, be 6-8x more efficient with the added ability to train ourselves to not need the AGI",

Lex's concern was the rapidity of progress. Given the huge leap from Chat GPT to GPT-4, at a 6 month increment, and given also plugins, new interfaces, competitors, China, and the creation of tool chains that link AI output rapidly to IDE's, and other pipelines, for programming and scientific methods, it is frankly either disingenuous or foolish or cocky to NOT see that the profit motive of capitalism will drive the curve up into the exponential in a matter of years and then months, not decades. And THAT is freaking scary.",

Now what are these inventor guys planning for the humans is the question I want answered?  They obviously know the technology they are creating is creating human obsolescence. Example: The CD replaced the Tape, then came the computer and files shared using Napster. Monetizing music became a huge problem.  AI replaces low level humans, then high level humans, then monetizing humans will become a major problem that can only lead to genocide.  Its easy to justify killing people for the greater good when they become useless.  We need serious human rights laws NOW.  People have been engineering systems to accomodate human needs for years but now it seems like the human is being engineered to accomodate the system.  Just look at society today and you can see the syntax of the ordinary person is more aligned to make it fit with the machine instead of the opposite.  This can only lead to the further demise of humanity, I dont care how you justify needing it.  I vote we all stay ignorant and happy and enjoy eachothers company on this planet instead of pushing the boundaries of humanity to technocracy and controlled demolition and the AI diety god that will be forced upon many to worship.  This could easily lead to vast majorty of people living in scenarios much depicted in the movies hunger games and Terminator.",
