He basically says that the answer is to allow the user to choose how and what the biases of the model are when interacting with you. \n\nThe reason the is a powerful solution is that it gives the user the ability to choose 'environment'. We all know about nature vs nurture. Nurture being the environment and people we surround ourselves with that changes us. If we can choose for ChatGPT to have certain characteristics and traits that we ourselves want to develop overtime, then its no longer a negative. Its a massive positive. \n\nWe'd have to be able to trust that the ai systems behaviors and biases are actually how we wanted it to behave when we interact with it, but this could be incredibly powerful for people. \n\nIt could become a personal mentor with the biases, behaviors, and traits that we want ourselves to have in the future. In essences it would become a sort of parental figure that we go into child mode and copy after and grow.  Again we have to have implicit trust that its behaving how the user wants it to behave.",

Because a regular person would understand that the amount of characters used to form a sentence or phrase majorly depends on grammar, which primarily depends on phrases/words used to describe the said character. Now it may refer to an action, hence verb, which would have different grammar settings than when used a preposition or adjective. And after all that it will also depend on perspective tone, and mood on how the specific characters are used, interpreted, arranged and described. While a machine picks randomly in all of this, without having a relative basis, it's hard to describe or understand any mood or tone, as in humans, it may depend on n number of factors. \n\nAs well when I asked Chat GPT numerous questions limiting the character and sentence limit, it still failed to comply many a times. I guess this should be enough but for the ignorant masses counting the character rather than building up character, above paragraph should provide good explanation.",
