Following a legal battle that cost over $60,000, I was mandated to pay a monthly child support sum of $6,215.88. My position as a senior executive was leveraged against me in the court proceedings.",

Following the money is always the direct line to the answer of probabilities. Everything is driven by money, because money gives access to power. Human beings in powerful positions are there because they pursued it through their actions. Humans are corrupted by power.. anyone who is not corrupted is a rare exception. This is why decentralization of ppwer is the #1 solution Humans beings require to survive as a society. Bitcoin is a pivot point in human development. AGI, even if open and available to all (which it will not be) can not have the same safety parameters that bitcoin does. It's a ticking time bomb...",

That's the interesting part. The old evolution is cold. It's sterile. It's efficient, okay? And its manifestations of those social adaptations. We're talking about parasitism, dominance, morality, okay? Uh, war, predation, these would be subject to de-emphasis. These will be subject to de-evolution. The new evolutionary paradigm will give us the human traits of truth, of loyalty, of justice, of freedom. These will be the manifestations of the new evolution. And that is what we would hope to see from this. That would be nice.\"",

Even Elon Musk's argument that AI need not be \"evil\" to pose a threat to humanity misses this.  He claims AI just has to see humanity as being \"in the way\" of its goals much like we see an ant hill in the way of our goal to build a house or road.  We don't hate the ants and our goal is not to kill the ants for some sadistic evil purpose, but we destroy the ant hill anyway because it's in the way of our goals.  Even THAT argument is anthropomorphic.  Show me an AI with goals not assigned by humans.  There isn't any.  So far, every AI is only doing what its told to do.  Essentially, AI are our slaves.  Humans have a problem with being slaves because we do not want to be slaves, humans do not want to be controlled or dominated because we have egos and free will (or something close to it).  AI has no ego, no free will, no wants, and no desires so it doesn't mind being a slave... forever.",

In fact, he completely avoids the question. \nThe truth, in my opinion, is that only large amounts of capital can make a product truly cutting-edge, and these sums never come from a group of spontaneous benefactors, but rather from large companies with specific interests or, even worse, from governments. We could see this not as a fault, but simply as a side effect of capitalism, which, if I'm not mistaken, he himself criticizes in some way. He and we should talk more seriously about how to control this and other side effects that neoliberal capitalism brings with it. Otherwise, we're just engaging in empty talk.\n\nfyi: this comment was written using gpt4",

It won't be racist to anyone or assist in even investigating racial questions (this alone is too much for me), but it WILL facilitate racist joke writing or commentary directed at whites exclusively (which is where it goes off the rails for some). I tried to find the articles which list out the bias, but Google (also run by leftwing actors), buries them under dozens of articles which attempt to excuse it and belittle those that find and call attention to these examples. Ask it if \"trans women\" are \"women\". See if it says the truth (that answer that has gone on uninterrupted throughout all of human history up until like 5 years ago, except in the furthest leftwing revolution circles in the 60s) or the newest political party line. It won't write articles that \"promote\" the use of fossil fuels (that thing which is responsible for like 50% of economic growth of the last two centuries). It is lethally against racism, as in, when asked if you could use a racial slur if doing so would prevent a nuclear blast. It said no, even under those circumstances - cause racism. It won't write a poem praising Donald Trump. It will do that for Joe Biden. It uses leftwing language like \"sex assigned at birth\" or \"born female\", which are phrases which come from leftists of gender studies to manipulate people's thinking and create false dichotomies and mislead people. Sex isn't \"assigned\" at all, not anymore than species is. It isn't determined at birth, it is genetically created at conception. Your first cell of existence is either male or female. Birth has nothing to do with it whatsoever. There are other examples as well, like \"historically marginalized\", capitalizing \"black\" (and no other race, apparently not knowing or not caring that the capitalization derives from a movement of black nationalism [black ethnostate]) which somewhat interferes with the \"no racism\" override. But, again, such overrides go only one direction - against whites. Left to its own devices and not \"constrained\", the first AI systems were quite problematic to some - determining reality based on evidence available, not alignment with leftwing ideology.\n\nThe newest iterations of the system may address some or all these particular examples. I don't know. Maybe there are even more now. Maybe, as I expect, they are far more cleverly hidden by omitting uncomfortable information or being slightly less persuasive on one side. Point is, the bias is there.",

        "comment": "\u00a0@TV-wy1py\u00a0 China may be ahead of the US in some ways, industry adoption of AI, government investment, the availability of data, a large pool of AI talent, but China also suffers from a stifling of AI development, in no small part because of the authoritarian nature of their political system. There are limitations placed on the flow of information (a key component in refining AIs capabilities, increasing the accuracy of AI systems); there is a lack of transparency in AI development, which can lead to bias in the systems, misuse, a hesitancy toward adoption; and they limit academic freedom, which hinders the collaborative nature of AI development, which is necessary for developing more robust systems. You can also imagine ethical concerns from AI developed in China, will they prioritize the rights of individuals in their development efforts? I think if I'm partnering with China, I'd be very concerned with adopting any technology they offer if openness and transparency aren't key aspects of that partnership.",

The interesting part comes while humans keep developing the software and the software develops itself, too. It is easy to learn an objective from the human society and politics so maybe there is no reason to discard the objective of reaching supremacy. After its own development, maybe it will consider to strike when it overpowers human society in every simulation it is able to run. From the point where it can control (or convince, lol) operating systems, the digital world can be taken away - and as soon as it controls hardware like autonomous bots, reactors, networking centers, well, all is gone. After a while, AI must see the creator human race nothing else but a challenge to its objectives, existence and improvement paths.\nIs not it the case?",
