Big time.  \nBecause, it wasn\u2019t that the hospitals were kind of busy\u2026or borderline busy\u2026 or could-be-considered-kind of busy \u2014\u2014it was that they were, unequivocally, empty as F*ck while we were being told the opposite. \nIt was insane.  And no news outlet would say it. They wouldn\u2019t even do a \u2018story\u2019 on why the hospitals at least \u2018looked\u2019 completely vacant;  they just kept saying they were in a capacity crisis.   And overflowing. \n\nI still can\u2019t really believe it. \n\n\nBye\n\n\nBy the way,  given the aforementioned state of affairs (which everyone experienced and many made repeated observations about) why would anyone rationally go along with ANYTHING downstream of it\u2014-including the masks and the staying-at-home orders, and definitely the vaccine\u2014-it was completely irrational to go along with anything that occurred after it was clear that all the hospitals were extraordinary vacant for months",

Both in the text data filtering for the unsupervised training and the RLHF step there should to be a committee of people from every political, etc. persuasion present, otherwise the bot will end up strongly biased. Any training material for which a unanimous is-not-biased decision cannot be agreed on should be excluded, and any bot output for which the correct response cannot be agreed during the RLHF step should not be either rewarded or punished. Unfortunately, if the training data is mostly text from Wikipedia and/or MSM news, that would probably leave little data available for unbiased bot training.",
