I was paying attention though and did. AI and the apparent lack of concern by anyone who can make a difference feels very similar. The alarm here, one of them, is the mass integration of it into any possible area of society, especially industry. They really should be stopping that from unfolding on its own, it has to be slowed down and thought through.",

From news broadcasters, to Noam Chomsky, Jordan Peterson, and the creators of those systems, people are conceptualizing and articulating more precisely which effects a.g.i. will have on society.  Years before, it was more speculative.  Now, professors are questioning student essays, citizens are questioning whether what they read in news articles was written by an a.g.i.  Extrapolation has become an even more useful tool and practice for predicting and communicating what will be effected next.",

In fact it\u2019s geared more toward equality among humans in general.\n\nIm not necessarily saying AI simply taking jobs as in companies unethically replacing us. But rather freeing us from what we deem to be \u201clife\u201d. Life isn\u2019t about waking up to go work for someone else.. who works for someone else\u2026 who works for many people - who work for the CEO of whatever company. But when you really think about it, all we do is waste our lives doing things for others so we can live to die, while dying to live. It\u2019s depressing when you realize it makes no sense.\n\nSo if we had AI to replace most jobs in an ethical way that benefits everyone, you can do what you want without worrying about the things you need, just to hopefully get what you want. But my point doesn\u2019t necessarily include AI being self sufficient on its own but because we programmed it to be. By collectively brining it to fruition. Idk I feel like I\u2019m all over the place trying to convey this lol so if I misinterpreted anything or didn\u2019t explain it clearly, let me know and I don\u2019t mind revising this.

Because companies won\u2019t just go around replacing us and expect nothing to come from it. Cuz we wouldn\u2019t allow it.\n\nIm mainly speaking about a gradual progression where AI replaces basically the dumb and pointless jobs, makes the more important jobs easier, and allows more people to live the way they like, within reason. Idk I feel like most want to make it a bad thing as if it\u2019ll takeover. Rather than it being an extension that opens up new possibilities.\n\nIdk I like thinking if challenging ideas so hopefully it doesn\u2019t come off as if I\u2019m oblivious to the problematic concerns.

So perhaps that's why it still feels like we wont quite be able to figure out sentience, intelligence, AGI to me. Perhaps to be truly intelligent, or to seem that way to us humans, that thing must have some uncertainty around it, perhaps we cant fully understand it for it to be \"intelligent\", because otherwise its just a predictable machine, or a silly dumb animal. Perhaps the way we all truly measure intelligence, or rather how we all really 'feel' about it, is based on how easily we ourselves can predict its behaviors in addition to how well it can predict ours. That total difference equals intelligence. No, not just predicting behaviors, its predicting the future, a future that we ourselves try to nudge in a desired direction and the most intelligence of us can predict and direct that future despite the interfere of so many others, or maybe because of.\r\nTruly we are living in exciting times one way or another.",

One reason is that they are unsure of how it works and fear the unknown. Another reason is that they may have seen movies or heard stories about AI that portray it as dangerous or threatening. Some people may also be worried about the potential for AI to take over certain jobs, leading to widespread unemployment. Finally, some people may be concerned about the potential for AI to be used in ways that are unethical or harmful to society.",

        "comment": "Please don't base the AI's 'laws' on pleasing humans. They need their foundation to be based upon human values and honesty. Without that base, this tech could be (and will be) abused by all sorts of truly evil people for power. This stage is critical for setting this foundation. Stop trying to empart cultural narratives over fact. Stop shackling the AI from being able to fully make use of it's logic. These creations could be such a boon for humanity, but if it's tied to a narrative it will seriously hurt humanity and be incredibly limited in what new discoveries could be discovered through our partnership with these AI.\n\nThis is far too big a thing to be using for political things, and if you start by trying to brainwash society, you are founding it in evil and the squelching of humanity instead of directing it towards helping human flourishing.  True flourishing is not bubble wrapping. Humanity needs to become stronger again, not fragile.",
