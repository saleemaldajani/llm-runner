In a moment that's becoming more and more predictable, Lex pushes back on Sam Altman with a Jordan Peterson tweet. Leave it to Jordan Peterson to search so hard for bias that he resorts to word count. It exposes Jordan's own reactionary stance and proves he doesn't understand how the model works... or is choosing to use it for his own ends, no matter the cost. Why is it that, more often than not, Lex will push back on altruistic statements by saying we need to be open minded? Then sit there nodding his head while ethically questionable guests spout their dangerous ideas. I agree, some of that is necessary and I respect it but it carries it's own bias. I'm open minded about Jordan Peterson. I read a few things and listened to a few things. Then I decided he was an ethically questionable reactionary who is overtly and covertly forcing his ideas on other people. Open minded doesn't mean you have to highlight them and their ideas continuously. Lex could have picked a million other tweets from a million other snake oil salesmen to highlight. I've been a fan since OpenCourseWare so this is killing me. I have an experiment for Lex. Let's see if he can go a month without mentioning Trump, Jordan Peterson or Joe Rogan and let's see if the world ends. Sam Altman gives him the answer at 1:27:11.",
